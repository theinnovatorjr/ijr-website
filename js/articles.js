   content: `<p>This upcoming Christmas season, the distant sounds of people chattering, cheering and laughing—turning into a cacophony of enjoyment, while pieces of popcorn fall from the cheese-covered fingers of each person that passes by in front of you as you stare up in wonder into the lights that shine upon you.
You, as if mesmerized, you take a few singular steps towards the picture covers[d] plastered across the cinema walls that seem to hypnotize you. Each step creating a crackling noise from under your foot, and
By each crack, a beam of light peaks through the opening as if it resembles that of a graceful opportunity to once again, look back upon the past that only now you deem nostalgic. But peaking through that whiteness, we capture a sight of the beaming beauty of Filipino Films.
Now celebrating its 51st annual year, each year that goes by is a “New Era for Philippine Cinema”. Filipino films evolve, conjure our nostalgic past only for it to turn better, progressing into this snowball of chilling, surprising, and thrilling shows that will surely charm us into setting our eyes straight on one thing only–The screen that will play out our romantic fantasies, baring into life our hidden aspiration, and unraveling the raveled.
Presenting to you, the Metro Manila Film Festival, where movie theaters encircle upon Filipino Films to which we learn to admire that of our own cultural, traditional stories.
This event gives us an opportunity to celebrate the films made by Filipino directors and their admirable imagination to come up with scripts and scenes that, of course, never fails to make us chuckle or squirm in our seats, and even activate our very own imagination, and inspire us.
The Metro Manila Film Festival exhibits a colorful creativity, refracting towards the mirror of our own unique Filipino culture and imagination that fascinates into wonderful scenes in a film that will never fail to elicit a reaction from all of us. 
This year’s upcoming MMFF will be bright like the moon, bigger than before, and prouder than ever for us Filipinos to celebrate the never-ending stories of what we still have to tell, and what we still have to show even under the falling snowflakes that will mirror the proud, inspirational us. 
This year’s Film Festival will prove only one thing–Filipino films aren’t just made for this Christmas season, but to expose the spectacle of our minds, of our country, of our creativity and of our souls as being Filipinos.

   content: `<p>On Thursday, Vice President Sara Duterte revealed that the Department of Education (DepEd) used its designated confidential funds to investigate alleged corruption within the agency, specifically concerning irregular laptop purchases.
Duterte disclosed the details as she spoke at the Pandesal Forum at the Kamuning Bakery, adding that the probe also included a ₱2.9 billion deal for outdated and overpriced laptops. 
The laptop procurement anomalies costing ₱2.4 billion began in 2021 during the tenure of former DepEd Secretary Leonor Briones, who was among the officials charged by the Office of the Ombudsman over the alleged irregular deal.
The laptop deal involved Sunwest Construction, owned by ex-Ako Bicol Rep. Elizaldy Co, one of the key figures in the flood control scandal.
However, Duterte’s statement contradicted DepEd’s assertion in 2023 that they were unaware of Duterte’s depletion of ₱112.5 million funds. 
Citing the Commission on Audit (COA), Duterte declined to comment on the use of confidential funds, stating that COA is the appropriate agency to disclose such information.
Duterte clarified the procurement occurred not within DepEd but through the Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM), adding they could only blacklist the companies. 
Duterte’s failed blacklist plan was followed by investigations from COA and the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee.

   content: `<p>Every day, countless animals wait patiently behind the walls of local shelters—their eyes full of hope and their hearts full of love. The spark in their spirits never fades, despite the number of visitors who always pass them by. Some have been abandoned, others lost, and many have never known what a home truly feels like. Yet, even in the quiet corners of their cages, there’s still trust—the belief that someone kind will come along.
This is what World Animal Day, on every 4th of October, should remind us of: that every living creature deserves to be treated with care and respect. It’s a call to action for all of us to show compassion in the ways we can: adopting instead of shopping, supporting local animal shelters, donating food or toys, or simply spreading awareness about animal welfare.
Let’s stand for those who cannot speak for themselves. It doesn’t take much effort to be kind to the innocent creatures around us—whether they are old or young, big or small, or even cute or fierce. Give all of them a second chance.

   content: `<p>In the busy streets of Davao City, a lot of things can be noticed, from cars cruising, children frolicking around the side of the road, to a street vendor selling fresh durian in their stall. It seems normal at first but then suddenly you feel the ground start to rumble intensely, cars begin to halt and crash, the children once playing stopped to let out a sharp cry, and the street vendor you saw selling is now hiding under their stall out of terror and anxiety. This is what occurred on October 10, as a 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck Davao Oriental.
After that incident, many suffered and questioned why earthquakes keep occurring and why they strike different parts of the Philippines so frequently; the answer lies in the activity of the Philippine Trench. The Philippine Trench is a vast and bottomless oceanic trench located east of the Philippines. It's about 1,320 kilometers long from the main island of Luzon to Halmahera Indonesia.
Additionally, according to Insight Philippines, the Philippine Trench was formed because of the Philippine Sea Plate moving under the Eurasian Plate, this is known as subduction. The subduction mechanism between the two plates still continues to this day as the Philippine Sea Plate continues to sink 15 cm under the Eurasian Plate per year.
Consequently, this subduction mechanism is the main component behind the recent earthquakes found in the Philippines, as this subduction mechanism generates immense stress to both of the plates and when the accumulated stress exceeds the strength of the rocks found in the plates, it then releases the stress, like a ticking time bomb waiting to explode any moment, which results in earthquakes happening.
According to Renato U. Solidum Jr, Director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHILVOLCS), he states that the Philippine Trench is a major feature under the ocean that causes many earthquakes in the area, and understanding its dynamics on how it works is vital for improving earthquake preparedness and further mitigating disaster impacts in the Philippines.
Now as the ground begins to settle, rescuers attend to the injured, citizens emerge from their shelters, and everyone rejoices for their safety. But from a once calm city, chaos ensued and catastrophes transpired, the aftermath was heartbreaking for the people of Davao. Cracks in the road were formed, houses of many were in ruins, and what's worst of it all is that lives were taken.
However, this calamity is just the beginning, based on an article from PHILVOLCS, The people in Davao Oriental can expect aftershocks in the epicentral area, the surface of where the earthquake originated. These aftershocks could persist for several days to weeks, and some may be felt in nearby provinces.
Furthermore, PHILVOLCS also advises to prepare for aftershocks by following the “Drop, Cover, and Hold” procedure to protect yourself from injury. At home and in workplaces, secure heavy furniture, appliances, and hanging objects to prevent accidents. Lastly, exercise caution around buildings and structures showing signs of damage, and coordinate with local engineering offices for inspection and safety guidance.
So as life slowly returns to normal in Davao Oriental, the memories of destruction and loss remain fresh in the hearts of its people. The recent earthquake was a harsh reminder of the Philippines’ vulnerability due to its location along the restless Philippine Trench. Though the earth beneath may shake and break us apart, the spirit of the Filipino people shall remain enduring and everlasting, ready to rebuild, recover, and restore harmony from a disaster caused by the depths.

   content: `<p>  For us students, unexcused absences are met with sanctions—failed assessments, lowered grades, or even lost privileges. Clamors for accountability echo throughout academia, reminding its constituents of the weight of responsibility that accompanies every action, or lack thereof. Yet in the grand classroom of government, those seated in the highest offices evade their call of responsibility for the sake of political survival.
            In a decisive move, the lower chamber reduced the proposed 2026 budget of the Office of the Vice President from ₱889.2 million to ₱733.2 million, reverting it to its 2025 figures. This came after Vice President Sara Duterte’s repeated snub of the Congress’s budget hearing, which the latter saw as disrespectful and unaccountable.
            In school, showing up is part of learning. In government, showing up is part of leading. Accountability cannot be taken by silence nor fulfilled by absence. It demands the active participation of those in power, coupled with their willingness to answer questions and stand firm in the light of public scrutiny. Because in every peso lies not only the tax of the people but also the public’s hope for a better future.
            The decision was not merely numerical; it is a reminder that accountability cannot be bought by delays and disregard. I, as a student myself, face the bludgeoning calls for responsibility when I fall short of expectations. Seeing the second-highest official in the land evade such necessary standards exposes a troubling paradox—ordinary citizens are punished for absence, while those in power see public service as a negotiable duty.
            With that, glimmers of hope fade into the depths of greed and complicity. Allowing such double standards to exist is caging oneself in the system that prioritizes personal gain. The values of honesty, fairness, and responsibility that were once taught to us as foundational to civic engagement lose meaning when practiced selectively. And as trust erodes, so too does the belief that change is possible, dimming the ideals and aspirations of the nation.
            As Leila de Lima has said, “public money is not a toy.” If students demand accountability and transparency in student leadership, then the public should uphold the same standards for those in power, where the stakes are higher and every move costs the blood, sweat, and tears of the Filipino people. Public funds are not gifts nor privileges; they are change catalysts that can make or break the nation. As such, the House’s move to scrutinize and sanction allotted funds speaks well of hope and integrity—and rightfully so.
            In the grand scheme of things, not everything is political. Scrutiny should not be seen as hostilities masked in inquiries but rather as a shared commitment to protect the common good. I am livid at the thought that if we continue to turn a blind eye, public funds will become weaponized for political propaganda, and trust will become a fragile illusion built upon years of negligence. And as indifference grows, the line between governance and greed blurs—leaving us not to question when the system broke, but when we stopped caring that it did.
            In the years to come, let us not treat accountability as a charity; it is not theatrical nor emotional. Accountability does not call for the people’s sympathy; it calls for the clean government the Philippines earnestly deserves. Falling deeper into the pit of flawed execution of checks and balances is a sin to the next generation. As said, those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it—and perhaps, that’s the point. The cycle of accepting silence as a sufficient response leads the country nowhere but ruin. Let this be the generation that topples the tyranny of mediocrity.
            Hands clean and head up high, I believe that hope is still alive beneath the rubble of prolonged accountability. Beacons of light remain visible to the masses, protecting the integrity and dignity of the institution that sought to battle injustice and inequality. Eyes opened with truth and conviction, I have faith that the future remains bright, albeit tedious. I challenge every finger that lies across this: to write not excuses, but actions; not absences, but answers. Because at the end of the day, we will all succumb to whatever fate the government chooses to pursue.

   content: `<p>The National University–Nazareth School (NUNS) Bullpups displayed composure and determination to outlast the Far Eastern University (FEU) Baby Tamaraws in an intense five-set showdown, 3–2 (23–25, 25–23, 25–23, 12–25, 15–12), in the UAAP Season 88 Boys’ Volleyball tournament held on October 12, 2025, at the Blue Eagle Gym.
Both teams battled fiercely from start to finish, trading powerful spikes and crucial defensive stops in a match that kept the crowd on edge. FEU took the opening set with the unstoppable performance of Kenneth Jan Maliwanag, who led the charge with 24 attacks out of 46 attempts. Setter Brix Landicho provided stability for the Baby Tamaraws, dishing out 19 excellent sets, while Tyler Jessie Ramos contributed 14 points along with 13 receptions to set the tone early.
NUNS, however, quickly recovered in the following frames. Xandrex Ragusta powered the Bullpups with 22 attack points, supported by Ronnie Millan’s 16 and Emerson Lejano’s 13 as they turned the tide to take the second and third sets. Their front line found its rhythm, while setter Johanz Brylle Crespo commanded the offense with precision and consistency.
Refusing to go down quietly, FEU roared back in the fourth set with renewed aggression. Ron Andrei De Vera and Eldrielle Manlapaz made their presence felt at the net, while Maliwanag and Ramos continued to deliver offensively. The Baby Tamaraws dominated the set, 25–12, forcing a deciding fifth.
In the final frame, NUNS showed their championship composure. Crespo directed the plays with 21 excellent sets, while libero Geoff Adrian Deniega anchored the floor defense with 15 digs and 31 receptions. Despite FEU’s late push, NUNS held their ground with steady serving and smart net defense to close out the match, 15–12.
Statistically, NUNS finished with 66 attacks, 55 excellent receptions, and 25 excellent sets, while FEU registered 63 attacks and 38 receptions. The match was a showcase of skill, heart, and resilience from both sides.
After the game, FEU head coach Rene Al Dulay commended his team’s effort but acknowledged the lapses that proved costly in the end.
“We’ve played well but the problem is on the latter part, medyo nag-lapse kami especially on the blocking and receive. But definitely, overall assessment, very good ang match. Hindi naman pwedeng dalawa ang mananalo, kailangan isa lang. We have to prepare pa talaga, we have to practice pa,” said Dulay.
He also emphasized the importance of preparation for their next outing.
“For next plans on the next game, we have to prepare. Hindi naman pwedeng balewalain yung UE — they’re playing well. Ibalik lang yung system na ginagawa namin and continue practicing.”
With the victory, NUNS tightened its grip on a top spot in the standings, while FEU looks to regroup and bounce back stronger in their upcoming match against the University of the East.

   content: `<p>Alab… Kilos… Awit… Bayan… Naririnig mo ba ang sigaw ng lansangan? Mga himig ng sama-samang dibdib. Mga kamay na nakataas, ‘di upang manakit, kundi manindigan para sa kinabukasan ng sambayanan. Mga sigaw na ‘di musika sa tenga ng makapangyarihan, dahil naririnig nila ang awitin ng katotohanan. Mga salitang kasing ganda ng mga dasal na inuusal sa loob ng ospital. At kasabay ng paglakad ng mga tao, may isang trabahador na nakikidaan lamang. Di alam ni Eric Saber na sa iilang sandali, magiging bahagi siya sa rason ng paghiyaw ng bayan. Ramdan mo sa kalsada ang munting apoy sa puso ng mga tao noong ika-21 ng Setyembre. Habang nagmamartsa ang kilos-protesta, mayroong nanonood na unipormeng para sa bayan ngunit babad na babad sa dugong galing sa bayan. Hawak nila ang kanilang pilak, isang pilak na sa isang maling hawak, maaaring makatigil ng pag pikit-mata.
Anino… Karahasan… Agos… Buhay… May halimuyak ng tensyon na di matanggal sa balat. Ang hangin ay nag-amoy tanso at puno ng abo. Narinig mo ba iyon! Isang putok sa gitna ng mga sigaw, ito’y bumasag sa araw.  Ang bala’y dumaan sa daang daang tinig. At sa isang pagpikit, humandusay sa aspalto ang isang sibilyang walang kamalay malay ngunit natamaan ng ligaw na galit. Ang init ng lupa’y humahalo sa nanlalamig niyang katawan. Ang dugong bumubuhay sa kanya noon ay nakalampaso at umaagos sa kalsada ng Recto. At ang ilaw ng SOGO sa kanto, kumuti-kutitap na parang kandila sa lamay. Nagtakbuhan ang mga tao dahil sa kanilang na masdan. May batang umiiyak sa poste, hinahanap ang kaniyang magulang. Si Eric Saber—isang manggagawang ninanais makauwi lamang, isang manggagawang nanonood lamang, naglapat ang mga mata. Sa gitna ng ingay, ang kaniyang mundo’y inangkin ng katahimikan. Ang kaniyang leeg butas, gawa ng mga taong dapat nagpoprotekta sa kanya.
Abusado… Kapangyarihan… Awtoridad… Brutalidad… Binalutan ang kalsada ng dilaw, tila tinatago ang katotohanan sa bayan. Sa bawat sulok, may alaala ng sumbrero na naiwan sa takbuhan. Naririnig mo ba ang sabi ng kapulisan? Sa ngalan ng ani nilang kapayapaan, ngunit sila rin ang sanhi ng kamatayan. Sa bawat kalabit ng gatilyo, may buhay na binabawian—isang buhay na dapat nilang binabantayan. Ang kalye ay nagiging larangan ng kanilang kapangyarihan, ang masa ay nagiging kalaban ng sariling bayan. Hindi ba’t sila dapat ang sandigan ng pag-asa, hindi dahilan ng takot sa sarili mong bayan?
Alaala… Kandila… Apoy… Bisig… Narinig mo ba yun? Ang sabi sa tabi-tabi, pupunuin ang kalsada ng sampaguita para sa isang bulaklak na pinitas bago mamulaklak. At papahiran ng tunaw na kandila ang bato kung saan siya humimlay—isang alay sa ngalan ng hustisya. May bulong ang hangin at ito ang ngalan ni Eric. Matapos ang trahedya, may mga batang nagtatakip ng tenga pag may sirena, mga inang nanginginig pag may pulis sa labas ng bintana. Nagliyab ang distrito ng kandila para kay Eric. Nawa’y habang dumaan ka sa Recto, maalala mo siya. Maalala ang kaharasan ng kapulisan sa kaniya. Alalahaning kahit ang tahimik ay papatahimikin ng polisya dahil alam nila ang kanilang kapangyarihan. Ikalat ang balitang galing sa bayan ko, at ang mga pangyayaring naganap sa lupang ipinangako.
Elisiya… Recto… Inapakan… Kinabukasan….

   content: `<p>On the Friday morning of October 10, a magnitude 7.4 earthquake struck off Davao Oriental, followed by 6.9 tremors after 10 hours, reportedly causing the deaths of seven people. 
The earthquake was the third to hit the country within 10 days and the strongest yet, with its epicenter being 40-60 kilometers southeast of Manay coast. On September 30, Cebu was hit by a magnitude 6.9 temblor that killed 74 people.
Consequently, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) issued tsunami alerts to coastal towns of Davao Oriental, Surigao del Norte, and Surigao del Sur after the 6.9 quake at 7:12 p.m., with 458 aftershocks recorded in 41 different areas in Davao Oriental at 8p.m.
Moreover, there were the common cries of people saying, “Lord, tabang! Hunonga na, Lord!” (Lord, help us! Let this stop, Lord!). It was captured on raw videos uploaded on social media as people rushed out of office buildings and their homes to seek safety in the chaos.
According to PHIVOLCS, the temblor’s “ground motion” was also felt beyond eastern Mindanao and reached as far as Leyte and Samar in Eastern Visayas, Bohol in Central Visayas, and Iloilo, Antique, Capiz in Panay Island, and Negros Occidental in Western Visayas.

   content: `<p>The Adamson University Lady Baby Falcons opened their UAAP Season 88 High School Girls’ Volleyball campaign in soaring fashion, sweeping the Far Eastern University–Diliman in straight sets, 25–20, 25–18, 25–16, in Preliminaries Round 1 at the Blue Eagle Gym on Saturday.
After last season’s runner-up finish, the Lady Baby Falcons showed they’re out for redemption — unleashing a sharp, composed performance that kept the charging Baby Lady Tamaraws at bay.
The first two sets showcased Adamson’s steady rhythm and on-court chemistry, but it was in the third frame where the Lady Baby Falcons’ composure truly shone. Trailing 12–14, they unleashed six straight points, capitalizing on FEU-Diliman’s errors to regain control. The momentum never shifted back, as the Falcons conceded just two more points before Francheska Adem punctuated the win with a scorching service ace — sealing the sweep in front of a roaring crowd of 536.
Leading the Lady Baby Falcons’ aerial assault was Ma. Ellaine Gonzalvo, last season’s Rookie of the Year, who erupted for 18 points built on 14 kills, three service aces, and a block. Adem added 12 markers, displaying her versatility at the net and behind the line.
Captain Elaine Faye Garces steered the offense with 14 excellent sets, ensuring the Falcons’ attacks stayed in sync, while defensive ace Mariana Maegan Pineda guarded the backcourt with 11 excellent digs and 14 receptions. Their teamwork and steady communication reflected a squad confident in both system and spirit.
On the other side, the Baby Lady Tamaraws showed grit despite the loss. Ifunanya Mary Udeagbala, the Nigerian middle blocker, led FEU–Diliman with 10 points through quick middle hits and tough net defense. However, the Tamaraws struggled to sustain momentum against Adamson’s relentless service pressure and organized blocking.
After the match, Adamson head coach JP Yude expressed satisfaction with the team’s debut but noted room for improvement:
“I'm proud sa mga bata. I'm happy sa first game nila. Kumbaga ‘yung iba, bago pa maglaro. So ‘yun lang, may mga kailangan lang din namin trabahuhin, ‘yung mga lapses namin for today. Pero unti-unti, kumbaga sa second game we need to adjust,” said Yude.
The match lasted 1 hour and 17 minutes, underscoring Adamson’s control and efficiency from start to finish. With this victory, the Lady Baby Falcons take an early flight atop the standings — ready to hunt for redemption and soar higher in the battles ahead.

   content: `<p>What lies beneath the surface of the Earth that makes it capable of such destruction? The ground we stand on is built up of massive slabs of rock called tectonic plates that are constantly moving, colliding, and grinding against each other in a silent, unstoppable rhythm. These invisible movements happen every day, unnoticed by most of us, until the tension becomes too much to bear. When that pressure finally breaks free, the ground trembles, and lives can change in a matter of seconds.
It’s strange to think that something so natural can cause so much chaos. Fault lines, the fractures where these blocks of the Earth’s crust move relative to each other, are like hidden boundaries of power. These movements release strain energy, resulting in earthquakes. They remind us that the Earth is alive—breathing, shifting, and reshaping itself through time. But if the planet’s movements are unpredictable, what happens if nature decides to remind us who’s really in control?
When the 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck Cebu around 9:55 PM, it was more than just a natural phenomena—it was a moment of collective fear, confusion, and disbelief. 69 facilities and more than 150 injuries were confirmed with significant damages to infrastructure. According to PHIVOLCS, Cebu, the home of 3.2 million Filipinos, was declared “a state of calamity” mobilizing emergency responses and neighboring areas.
The Earth had spoken, and everyone was forced to listen.
Imagine yourself going about your night thinking that it’s just every other quiet, peaceful night, when all of a sudden the ground below you shakes. How can someone comprehend the situation that happened that’s completely out of your control? Aftershocks followed, further disrupting rescue operations and delaying the arrival of the help they desperately needed.
Additionally, The earthquake originated within the complex fault systems of the Philippine Mobile Belt, between the converging Philippine Sea Plate and Eurasian Plate. Due to the interactions of the plates, this region became geologically active which then led to frequent seismic events.
The ground that people trusted suddenly betrayed them; roads cracked open, buildings swayed, and caused families to run out of their homes. In just a few seconds, the city changed. What once felt steady became fragile.
The Earth will always move, our planet does not stay put. But maybe these quakes are not just moments of destruction, but reminders of resilience. Cebu rose from the ruins, just as countless communities have after every tremor. We rebuild, we learn, and we adapt, even when the ground beneath us refuses to stay still. Perhaps the real power lies not in stopping the Earth from moving, but in understanding it—and in finding the strength to stand again every time it does.

   content: `<p>The FEU Tamaraws 16-under boys’ basketball team showed their determination and rising potential in the ongoing UAAP Season 88, proving that Tamaraws young guns are ready to uphold the green and gold pride.
Despite facing seasoned opponents, the Tamaraws decided to be brave upholding their school moto, leading the charge is Prince Cariño, who has been deadly consistent, averaging 23.5 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 1.5 assists per game, serving as the team’s primary offensive engine.
 Alongside him, Dwyne Enriquez has been a powerful complement, putting up 21.5 points and 7 rebounds per outing, and doing so with efficient shooting (53.03%) that helps stabilize FEU’s scoring when defenses clamp down.
On the perimeter, Prince Pineda has provided balance and clutch scoring: pulling up from deep with 66.67% accuracy in three-point attempts, while also grabbing 6.75 rebounds per game. In the paint, Dwayne Cañete and Hisham Mampao have held their ground, combining for 29 rebounds during the stretch, contesting drives, and anchoring the team’s inside defense.
The bench has also made its mark. Kyle Mojica has sparked momentum with 10 assists and 10 steals, constantly pressuring ball-handlers and creating transition chances, while Griffin Barlan has shown composure and efficiency, hitting 71.43% of his shots in limited minutes and providing steady depth when starters rest.
Over their four outings, the Tamaraws have scored a total of 319 points, collected 188 rebounds, and distributed 81 assists. Their defensive energy is evident too, with approximately 140 steals recorded, showing their ability to force turnovers and disrupt.
As the tournament progresses, the FEU Tamaraws 16-under continue to show that their spirit and determination match the tradition of excellence they represent,  Fortitude, Excellence and, Uprightness.

   content: `<p>Far Eastern University–Diliman (FEU-D) sustained its unbeaten streak in the UAAP Season 88 High School Boys’ Volleyball tournament by dispatching Adamson University in a thrilling four-set showdown, 25–19, 25–21, 26–28, 25–21, on Sunday at the Blue Eagle Gym.
The Baby Tamaraws came out with poise and precision, banking on Kenneth Jan Maliwanag’s scoring barrage and Tyler Jessie Ramos’s rock-solid reception to dictate the tempo early. Their sharp ball movement and defensive discipline overwhelmed the Baby Falcons, cruising to a 25–19 win in the opening set.
Adamson briefly threatened in the second frame, jumping to a four-point lead midway through. But FEU-D showed championship composure, rallying behind Ramos and Axel Terreng, whose timely kills completed the comeback, 25–21.
The Baby Falcons refused to fold, pushing the Tamaraws to their limits in the third set and capitalizing on FEU-D’s miscues to snatch it, 28–26. 
Unfazed, the Tamaraws tightened their block formation and regained rhythm in the fourth behind Brix Landicho’s deft playmaking and Ron Andrei De Vera’s imposing presence at the net, closing out the match, 25–21.

   content: `<p>The tremors struck without mercy. In one Cebu household, ceilings collapsed, and panic erupted. Amid the chaos, seventeen-year-old Lady Jane Ytang did not hesitate. As debris rained from above, she pushed her family to safety and used her own body as a shield. When the dust settled, Lady Jane was gone. Her death has been hailed as heroic, her name carried in tributes across the province. Yet behind the praise lingers a cruel irony: she should not have needed to die at all. Heroism, in this case, was demanded by neglect.
The magnitude 6.9 earthquake in northern Cebu claimed at least 72 lives and left hundreds injured. Historic churches were reduced to rubble, hospitals overflowed with casualties, and communities were cut off by landslides and impassable roads. The disaster tore through not only homes and heritage, but also the illusion of preparedness. The province, once celebrated as a vibrant hub of culture and progress is now a mess due to a tragedy that feels both natural and man-made.
To frame this disaster as something inevitable is to ignore the hard truth.  Yes, tectonic plates shifted and fault lines moved. But the extent of destruction is the result of long-standing negligence. Infrastructure that crumbles at the first violent jolt, heritage shrines that collapse without reinforcement, and communities left without immediate rescue, all speak of complacency posing as inevitability.
The very fault line that ruptured in Cebu had not moved in more than four centuries. That historical silence should have been treated as a warning, not as a reassurance. Instead, the dormancy of the fault lulled institutions into forgetting that Philippine soil sits squarely on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where earthquakes are not a matter of “if” but “when.” The Archdiocesan Shrine of Santa Rosa de Lima in Daanbantayan, among others, was reduced to rubble — a painful reminder that culture and history vanish when foresight is absent. This highlights that  dormant faults don’t mean dormant danger.
This was also not the first reminder. In 2013, the Bohol earthquake of magnitude 7.2 killed more than 200 people and damaged centuries-old churches across the Visayas. In 1990, the Luzon earthquake flattened Baguio City, killing thousands and isolating communities for days. And as far back as 1645, the so-called “Luzon Earthquake” destroyed Manila, earning the name Lindol ng San Andres for its ferocity. Each catastrophe left lessons carved into rubble, yet the pattern persists: short-term alarm, long-term amnesia.
Some say earthquakes are impossible to predict, therefore impossible to prevent. That much is true — prediction is beyond science, but prevention of large scale devastation is not. Countries such as Japan, equally quake prone, have demonstrated that rigorous codes, constant drills, and consistent enforcement dramatically reduce casualties. The claim that “nothing can be done” is not wisdom; it’s inaction.
This excuse is what continues to hover over the West Valley Fault, which cuts across Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Seismologists have long called it a “ticking time bomb,” warning that a rupture could kill tens of thousands in minutes, with aftershocks crippling the capital for weeks. Yet despite decades of alerts, the response has rarely gone beyond half-hearted drills and posters. If Cebu’s suffering cannot awaken urgency, what then will happen when the ground beneath the nation’s capital itself finally gives way?
Lady Jane’s sacrifice must not be turned into mere symbolism. To celebrate her courage without confronting the conditions that demanded it, is to betray her memory. The way forward is clear: enforce building standards, conduct real disaster drills, invest in early-warning systems, and hold leaders accountable so that resilience is no longer treated as destiny but built through genuine safety and preparedness. These are not just cracks in concrete; they are faults of neglect. And unless those faults are repaired, the next quake will write the same story again, only with new names etched in tragedy.

   content: `<p>Ipinunto ni Senador Risa Hontiveros na itinatago ng Senate Resolution No. 144 ang special treatment para kay Duterte bilang ‘humanitarian condition’ noong Oktubre 1, 2025.
Pinirmahan ni Majority Leader Migz Zubiri at Minority Leader Alan Cayetano ang Senate Resolution No. 144 na humihimok sa International Criminal Court na magtalaga ng doktor at isaalang-alang ang house arrest kung lalala ang kalusugan ni Duterte.
“Wala pong indikasyon na ang [ICC] ay nagpabaya sa pagbantay sa kalusugan at kagalingan ng mga taong nasa kustodiya nila,” ipinaliwanag ni Hontiveros.
“Maaaring naka-couch sa humanitarian terms. Pero nagmumukha ring isa pang halimbawa ng ating gobyerno na nagbibigay ng special treatment sa isang makapangyarihang indibidwal.” dagdag niya.
Kasunod ng pagtutol ni Hontiveros, kinilala ni Senador Kiko Pangilinan, bilang Chairman ng Committee on Justice and Human Rights, ang batayan para sa ‘humanitarian consideration’ gaya ng house arrest, ngunit iginiit niyang manaig ang daing para sa hustisya ng libo-libong biktima ng extrajudicial killings.
“Tungkulin kong pumanig sa mga daing ng naghahanap ng hustisya. I vote ‘No’.” ani ni Pangilinan.
Tinuligsa rin ni Senador Bam Aquino ang iminungkahing resolusyon.
Inaprubahan ng Senado ang resolusyon sa botong 15 pabor, tatlo tutol, at dalawang abstensiyon.

   content: `<p>De La Salle Santiago Zobel (DLSZ) fought off Far Eastern University–Diliman (FEU-D) in a heated four-set showdown, 25–23, 25–18, 24–26, 25–18, to notch its third win in the UAAP Season 88 High School Girls’ Volleyball tournament on Sunday morning at the Blue Eagle Gym in Quezon City.
The victory lifted the Junior Lady Spikers to a 3–1 record, strengthening their hold on a top-three spot as the first round nears its conclusion.
DLSZ displayed poise and teamwork, recovering from a tight third-set loss to close out the match with composure and energy.
Leading the charge was Aislinn Alemaña, who powered the team with 20 points built on 18 attacks and two service aces, capping another stellar all-around outing.
Zelaine Laborte backed her up with 14 markers and three aces, while Jelliane Laborte added 12 points, showing consistent play both at the net and on defense.
Setter Ma. Sabine Valdez directed the offense with 11 excellent sets and a pair of aces, dictating the pace and connecting seamlessly with DLSZ’s spikers.
Libero Angel Jaden Ceniza anchored the backcourt with 26 digs and 10 receptions, stabilizing the team’s floor defense and limiting FEU-D’s scoring runs.
The opening frame set the tone for a tightly fought match, with both teams going back and forth until DLSZ capitalized on FEU-D’s late error that sent the ball short, sealing the 25–23 win.
Riding that momentum, the Junior Lady Spikers steadied their defense and kept their composure, as FEU-D struggled with service miscues and failed receptions, allowing DLSZ to cruise to a 25–18 finish in the second set.
FEU-D mounted a spirited comeback in the third, keeping the rallies alive with sharp attacks and timely coverage to snatch a 26–24 escape.
However, costly errors in the service line and failed net blocks that landed short hampered the Lady Baby Tamaraws’ chances of forcing a decider.
DLSZ regrouped swiftly in the fourth, showing depth and balance as every rotation contributed to the scoring load and maintained intensity on both ends.
An emphatic crosscourt kill punctuated the win as DLSZ wrapped up the fourth set, 25–18, to clinch its third victory of the season.
Despite the loss, FEU-D’s Ifanya Mary Jane led all scorers with 20 points, while Aleah Mae Devosora added six markers, showing grit and determination for the Lady Baby Tamaraws.
Setter Emile Nahala Guivarras recorded 12 excellent sets, and Franz Premaylon tallied 15 digs, providing stability on defense amid the team’s struggles with errors.
With the result, DLSZ improved to 3–1, staying well within the upper half of the standings, while FEU-D dropped to 1–3, showing glimpses of promise and teamwork that could prove crucial in the coming rounds.

   content: `<p>University of Santo Tomas (UST) strengthened its title bid with a hard-fought 2.5–1.5 win over Far Eastern University–Diliman (FEU-D), while Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU) and De La Salle–Zobel (DLSZ) fought to an intense 2–2 draw in Round 3 of the UAAP Season 88 High School Boys’ Chess Championship last October 4 at the Adamson Gym.
UST’s breakthrough came on board three, where John Cyrus Borce turned the tables on King Xyan Beltran after a long defensive grind, launching a decisive counterattack that overwhelmed the FEU-D standout.
On board one, Arena International Master (AIM) Gabriel Ryan Paradero of UST neutralized Gladimir Chester Romero in a calm positional battle that quickly simplified into a draw.
FEU-D’s Arena Candidate Master (ACM) Joemel Narzabal salvaged a half-point against King Lanz Pamplona after finding perpetual check in a sharp middlegame where both kings came under fire.

With Borce scoring the lone victory, UST clinched the narrow 2.5–1.5 triumph to keep pace with the frontrunners.
Meanwhile, Ateneo and DLSZ traded blows in an evenly matched thriller that ended in a 2–2 deadlock.

The Tamaraws’ top boards delivered under pressure, led by Woman FIDE Master (WFM) Ruelle Canino, who powered FEU-D’s charge with a clinical win over Daren Dela Cruz, converting a sharp kingside attack with flawless endgame precision.
Ericka Ordizo doubled the Tamaraws’ lead after outplaying Trina Mhariz Temple in a tense Queen’s Gambit Declined, turning a chaotic middlegame into a dominant pawn advance.

   content: `<p>What began in Luneta, and ended in Mendiola was more than a march—it was a demand carved into the streets. It proved once more that the Filipino voice, when united, cannot be drowned out—not even with chaos intervening. Most know that the rally ended with clashes and chaos, but beyond the noise,  the rally was never truly about chaos, but about the voices of Filipinos pleading to be heard.
When the voices faded, what remained were the people themselves—tired, bruised, yet determined. There were ones who walked simply because the crowd moved, being swept away by the tide of people. Then, there were those who screamed until their throats burned, determined to lift up the voices of Filipinos higher, not only for themselves, but even for the nation aching to be heard.
In the middle of all this, a familiar figure was seen: Alvin ‘Vin’ Karingal, or the renowned “Fishball Warrior”. On social media, he had been turned into a meme, a face that has been passed on mainly for laughs—without much thought on what his voice was actually fighting for. But in Mendiola, he stood as more than what the internet made of him. He marched with the same grit as everyone else, his voice raw, his steps heavy but still enduring.
“Ibaba ang presyo ng fishball! Ibaba ang presyo ng kwek-kwek, tokneneng, calamares!”
Those were lines from Vin, what made many laugh  at, replayed, and turned into a joke. But if you read through the comments, the laughter was mixed with something else—people saying he spoke out of hunger, out of the weight of poverty that never makes it to the headlines. What others found funny was, for some, a mirror of their own struggle. His story does not fit into speeches or slogans, yet it carries a truth that most would rather look away from.
 A truth where change is not only about exposing the officials who exploit profit for power, but about protecting those who carry the weight of their abuse as well. Alvin Karingal was one of the people detained after the rally—this proves how easily ordinary people are being punished for raising their voices. This marks a reminder that behind every chant, there is a life to be seen and every arrest is a warning of how fragile our freedom can be.
Maybe that is what the rally was really about, the cries of ordinary Filipinos too often ignored—voices like Alvin’s, raw but carrying the heavy truth.
Online, people who once dismissed him as a meme, began to speak differently; one viral comment said, “He speaks for all of us who are hungry but still fighting.” Rappler’s report on the September 21 rally also noted how ordinary demonstrators, not just leaders, still carried the heart of protest forward. Perhaps real change is not measured by how loud we protest, but by whether we choose to carry with us stories that are hardest to face.
In the end, as the rally fades into the dusk of dawn, what remains is the choice to truly listen, especially to those who are struggling and those we often overlook. Our voices must rise not just against politicians and their betrayals, but also for people like Alvin—for people whose suffering is too easily dismissed. And if we are to hope for a better country, it must start with not turning our backs from those who need us most.
What we carry from the rally is not chaos nor blind rage, but the memory of a crowd that moved as one—each person fighting battles, and their voices rising, in hopes that their struggles would finally be seen.

It reminds us that newsrooms must give people reliable information and guard press freedom. In the Philippines, where community newspapers and big media outlets alike have faced many challenges, the day carries a deeper meaning—showing how vital local journalism is to every community. 
We celebrate this day not only to defend the truth but also to keep alive the hope that a free press will continue to guide, inspire, and empower the people.

If that day does not come, then that night will not be remembered as the worst of it. It will be remembered as the beginning. For what we witnessed was no longer just a march. It was no longer even a riot. It was the slow birth of reckoning—unplanned, unguided, unfiltered, but inevitable. And when a reckoning comes, it is not polite, it is not neat, and it does not ask permission. It arrives with stones, with fire, with blood. It arrives when people who have nothing left finally rise to collect the debt that has long been denied them.

   content: `<p>The streets of Manila reek of smoke and sorrow. The Trillion Peso March, once imagined as a dignified protest for accountability, has ruptured into something rawer and bloodier than any organizer foresaw. What began as chants and placards has become an inferno: stones crashing against shields, barricades consumed in flame, gunshots tearing through the air with the weight of finality. Along Recto Avenue, one cannot tell anymore where the rally ended and where the riot began; one can only trace the line of blood across the pavement and count the bodies left cooling under the dim glow of broken streetlights. Mothers scream names into the smoke. Fathers claw through barricades in search of children. Every cry of anguish is met not with aid, but with the cold silence of the state’s iron machinery. At least 216 people, including 89 minors as young as 12 years old, were arrested following the riots in Manila. Around 205 people, including 76 civilians and 129 police personnel, were injured. An unidentified person was also killed in a stabbing during the riot, while 48 others were injured and sent to the Jose R. Reyes Memorial Medical Center.
Yet to reduce this to violence alone is to tell only half the story. This chaos is not simply the product of reckless youth or opportunistic gangs, though both were present. Nor can it be dismissed as the work of professional agitators planted to sabotage the cause, though provocateurs are easy to imagine in the smoke. What unfolded in Manila and in cities across the country is the inevitable consequence of a betrayal too vast and too old to be contained by silence any longer. The people did not invent their rage; it was cultivated in them, drip by drip, each time billions vanished while classrooms rotted, while floodwaters swallowed homes, while families buried loved ones after disasters that could have been prevented had the money not been stolen. Corruption is not an abstraction here. It is hunger, it is ruin, it is the sound of gunfire cracking down because the state refuses to face its own crimes.
In Metro Manila, the scale was staggering. Tens of thousands converged at Luneta Park, swelling to some 45,000 by mid-morning according to disaster officials. At the People Power Monument, another 30,000 gathered, their chants reverberating against the walls of history. It was a sight meant to be dignified: flags rising, clergy praying, students marching, survivors speaking of lives shattered by floods that never should have reached their doorsteps. Yet beneath the prayers and speeches pulsed another reality: tension, anger, and the knowledge that this was not merely a rally for reforms, but a reckoning for betrayal too vast to remain polite. And even as casualties mounted, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Jonvic Remulla commended the 50,000 deployed Philippine National Police personnel for exercising maximum tolerance and ensuring what he described as the generally peaceful conduct of the “Trillion Peso March.”
The grievances themselves are carved deep. They are water filling living rooms, coffins carried through muddy streets, roofs ripped away while officials signed contracts for flood control projects that were never built, or built so poorly they collapsed before the first typhoon even touched land. Senate hearings have estimated that losses in anomalous projects may run into the trillions of pesos—trillions that could have built classrooms, hospitals, and sturdy defenses against rising waters, but instead evaporated into the pockets of men who now denounce “destabilization” from air-conditioned offices. These are not numbers. They are futures foreclosed before they even began.
The government insists it will not spare anyone. President Marcos Jr. has announced the creation of an independent commission, vowing that no ally, no inner-circle figure, will escape scrutiny. He has warned against violence, urged the nation to keep protests peaceful. And yet the state has deployed 50,000 police nationwide to “secure” the mobilizations—an army in all but name. How can citizens believe in accountability when the men sent to “protect” them stand in phalanx, shields raised, guns ready, as if the people were enemies of the state? Some accounts say shots were fired. Some whisper of missing persons who never came home. Whether every report is confirmed or not, the fear is real, and the distrust even more so.
The march was meant to reclaim dignity, but dignity is fragile in the face of poverty. As the crowd swelled and the hours wore on, hunger and exhaustion distorted purpose. Some broke away to loot not as ideologues but as survivors, turning to ransacked hotels and shattered stores because despair rarely marches in straight lines. And when the state, jittery and paranoid, met this despair with unrestrained force, it abandoned the pretense of protection. Tear gas choked children who did not even know what cause they had been dragged into. Gunfire felled men who carried nothing but their fists. Young women vanished into alleys where chaos offered cover for predators as much as for protesters. The state declared that law and order were under threat, but it is not law and order lying face down on the asphalt that night. It was the people—their voices silenced, their blood mixing with rainwater in the gutters, their dignity extinguished with the pull of a trigger.
What makes the tragedy heavier is how familiar it feels. We have seen this script before: unrest answered with repression, protest painted as criminality, mourning drowned by official statements written in cold, sterile language. We are told these are isolated incidents, the work of the unruly, the fault of nameless agitators. Yet we know better. The unrest is everywhere: in Bacolod, where fishermen carried banners scrawled with demands for justice; in Iloilo, where workers laid down their tools to join marches; in Cagayan de Oro, where students called corruption more dangerous than insurgency; in Baguio, where placards rose against the mist as chants demanded accountability. The details shift, but the essence remains: this is not one city’s chaos. It is the nation’s grief given form.
Still, amid the chaos, one truth cuts through the smoke: power is untouched. The politicians whose signatures gave birth to ghost projects, whose silence protected thieves, whose arrogance fed this rage—they were not in that rally. They were safe behind guarded gates, untouched by stones, deaf to sirens, blind to the dead. They issued statements condemning violence, as if they were not the violence itself. They pitted the poor against the police,  forced desperation to clash with desperation, then stood back and washed their hands. And so both sides lose. The rioter dead, the policeman bloodied, the bystander broken. And the victors? They sip wine in air-conditioned rooms, counting their winnings while the city counts its dead.
Some will argue this is chaos without cause, that the violence invalidates the message. But such an argument is cowardice dressed as civility. The outrage would not exist without the betrayal that preceded it. No child throws a stone at a line of armed men unless he has been cornered by a life of indignity. No mother braves tear gas unless her hunger is stronger than her fear. No city erupts unless the system meant to protect it has already abandoned it. The fire that started during the rally was not spontaneous combustion. It was the delayed explosion of decades of injustice, sparked at last into flame.
And yet, as the fires burn, whispers grow louder: this is Martial Law without proclamation. This is Martial Law 2.0 in practice, if not in name. An “order to shoot” drifts through the ranks like a chilling echo of 1972. Journalists are beaten back from the front lines, cameras smashed under boots, evidence of state excess erased in real time. Curfews rise overnight, checkpoints multiply, and the promise of “public safety” becomes the excuse to criminalize assembly altogether. What began as a march against corruption is being reshaped, by those in power, into justification for a crackdown that reaches far beyond Recto. It is not the violence they fear—it is the voice behind the violence. Silence that voice, and the thieves are safe again.
And yet, what hope remains if outrage is met only with blood? If this march ends in nothing but more dead, more wounded, more disappeared, then the message is clear: accountability is not possible within the walls of this republic. If the state insists on calling its people criminals for demanding justice, then it only proves itself criminal for denying it. This is not simply about flood control funds or ghost projects anymore. It is about the basic question of whether this nation belongs to its people, or to those who have plundered it dry.
That night, the country stood at a precipice. It could either listen to the screams of its people, or drown them once more in the silence of mass graves and official lies. But make no mistake: what burns in Recto will not remain in Recto. The smoke carries. It will rise over Bacolod, Iloilo, Baguio, Cagayan de Oro, Davao, Cebu, in other places here in our country. It will seep into classrooms where children ask why their parents never came home, into fields where farmers wonder why their taxes fed only the pockets of men in suits, into factories where workers know they are one calamity away from drowning in both flood and debt. The fire will not end until the theft ends, until justice is done, until the names of the guilty are named and punished, until the system that enabled them is torn down.
If that day does not come, then that night will not be remembered as the worst of it. It will be remembered as the beginning. For what we witnessed was no longer just a march. It was no longer even a riot. It was the slow birth of reckoning—unplanned, unguided, unfiltered, but inevitable. And when a reckoning comes, it is not polite, it is not neat, and it does not ask permission. It arrives with stones, with fire, with blood. It arrives when people who have nothing left finally rise to collect the debt that has long been denied them.

   content: `<p>Thousands of Filipinos rallied on September 21, 2025, in Manila under the banners “Baha sa Luneta: Aksyon Laban sa Korapsyon” and the “Trillion Peso March” to demand accountability over corruption in flood control infrastructure.
Participants, including students, church groups, labor and sectoral organizations, endured the rain and hot weather to gather at Rizal Park (Luneta) in the morning and later moved toward the People Power Monument along EDSA, Quezon City.
As of about 10:25 a.m., the city government estimates placed some 49,000 people in Luneta participating in the rally.
The anger fueling the protest was caused by ghost flood-control projects, alleged kickbacks involving contractors, and billions of pesos in public funds lost between 2023 and 2025.
Vice Ganda, Iza Calzado, Heidi Mendoza, and other celebrities addressed the participants with speeches urging transparency and unity.
Folk-pop band Ben&Ben performed “Kapangyarihan” and a special version of “Araw-Araw,” which echoed through the crowd as they sang along.
Church leaders, activists, students, and ordinary citizens carried placards with slogans like “Ikulong na ’yan, mga kurakot!” (Jail the corrupt) and symbolic items mocking corrupt figures to expound their message.
Authorities closed some EDSA roads by mid-afternoon as protesters traveled from EDSA Shrine to the People Power Monument, bringing traffic to a standstill and prompting route diversions.

   content: `<p>Limang dekada na ang nakalipas matapos isara ang pintuan ng demokrasya. Sa isang pagpikit ng mata, naging kulungan ang isang bansa sa Asya. Bawat singit ng kalsada’y binabantayan, at bawat tinig ay nilagasan. 
7:15 pm ng isang gabi ng sabado noong 1972, nagbukas ang telebisyon upang magbigay ng anunsyo ang dating pasista, abusado, naniniil, gahaman, utak-diktador, lapastangan, at oportunistang si Ferdinand Marcos.  
Kasabay ng mga kilos-protesta sa Maynila, sunod-sunod na pambobomba, pag-aalsa ng mga kilusang komunista, at di umano'y “pagsalakay” kay Defense Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile, ginamit ni Marcos ang lahat ng ito bilang dahilan upang ideklara ang Martial Law. Isang pagkilos na pinalamutian ng kasinungalingan at ipininta bilang para sa kabutihan ngunit sa katunayan ay paglalatag ng tanikala sa sambayanan.
Sa unang araw ng pagdeklara nito, tinamaan niya mismo ang iba’t ibang uri ng peryodismo upang manatiling puwang ang masa sa mga nangyayari. Ipinasara niya ang mahigit na 400 na plataporma ng midya tulad ng mga radyo, at mga mamamahayag. Hindi rin nakaligtas ang iba’t ibang mga kumpanyang nagbibigay serbisyo para sa bayan tulad ng Meralco, PLDT, NAWASA, at ABS-CBN. 
Pinadampot ni Marcos ang mahigit 8,000 na sibilyan na mamamahayag, estudyante, at mga manggagawa. Kasama dito ang apat na senador na tutol sa diktador na sina Ninoy Aquino, Pepe Diokno, Ramon Mitra Jr., at Soc Rodrigo.
Ngunit kahit sa harap ng malulupit na nangyari, marami pa rin ang bulag sa pahinang ito ng ating  kasaysayan dahil ang kalsada’y tahimik, ang mga krimen ay walang imik, nang hindi nalalaman na ang haligi ng demokrasya’y wala na. Walang korte, walang judicial system, at marami pang iba.
Kung kaya’t sa araw na ito, ika-21 ng Setyembre 2025, ginugunita natin ang ika-53 na anibersaryo makalipas ng Martial Law. Isang gabi ng ating bansa na pinili ng ilan na kalimutan. Ngunit ang gabi ay hindi nagtatagal. At ang alaala, kahit piliting burahin, ay patuloy na bumabangon. Sapagkat sa dulo ng bawat takipsilim, may araw paring sumisilip, at sana’y huwag na uling maiulit.
Limang dekada na ang lumipas, ngunit nananatiling bukas ang sugat ng nakaraan. Sa bawat pagsikat ng araw, nagpapaalala ito na ang kalayaan ay dapat bantayan. Sapagkat ang dilim ay muling babalik kung tayo’y pipikit, ngunit mananatiling buhay ang liwanag kung tayo’y magigising.

   content: `<p>As waitlisted transplant patients sigh of boredom, they hope and pray everyday for a miracle to appear before them, they long for fully functional organs that will enable them to live a perfectly normal life again, but instead of making them wait for a much more longer time, why don't we make these organs ourself to better benefit these patients and to end their days of waiting. That's where 3D-Bioprinting springs into action to aid these patients.
Imagine yourself with a 3D-Printer, making inventions with it using recycled materials or strings of plastics, same goes for 3D-Bioprinting, but instead of using ordinary materials, it uses living cells and biocompatible materials to create tissues and potentially full grown organs, that can help patients who are in need for a transplant surgery.
Furthermore, according to lead researcher, Nicholas Mirsky, early successes has been shown in bioprinting skin grafts, bone tissue, cartilage, and even mini-organ models, such as liver and kidney models which are already used for drug testing.
3D-Bioprinting works by collecting living cells and then transforming these into bio-ink; it's like the ink you use in a normal printer. Next, the printer prints the organs in a layer-by-layer style and deposits these bio-inks that will form tissue structures of the organ.
Moreover, they have advanced into bioprinting blood vessels in which it is used to circulate around the body, however, a problem for them that still remains is how they would incorporate these blood vessels into their large, fully vascularized organs.
Mirsky also wishes for fully functional organs such as kidneys, livers and hearts which could drastically reduce transplant waiting lists as these synthetic organs can be the future for Donor dependent patients.
“3D bio printing brings us closer to the dream of on-demand, patient-specific organs, but significant scientific and ethical challenges remain before clinical transplantation becomes a reality”, Mirsky said.
Lastly, with the saying goes, "Once a blood donor, always a lifesaver”, it's no mystery that even if we aim for 3D-Printed synthetic organs as the future of medicine, we shouldn't forget about the old ways of the past, where actual donors willingly gave up a part of themselves for the benefit and healing of others. As these donors treasure even more than a heart as pure as gold.

   content: `<p>Tuwing sumasapit ang Setyembre 21, nagkakahalo ang mga damdamin ng mga Pilipino. Para sa nakararami, ito ay isang araw ng paggunita sa madilim na yugto ng Batas Militar, isang panahong nag-iwan ng malalim na sugat sa ating kasaysayan. Ngunit sa paglipas ng panahon, ang Setyembre 21 ay hindi na lamang magiging alaala ng panunupil; ito ay magiging simbolo rin ng pagbangon at paglaban, isang araw kung saan muling ginagamit ng mamamayan ang kanilang boses laban sa mga isyung panlipunan at pampamahalaan.
Sa kasalukuyan, may mga panawagan para sa isang "Trillion Peso March" o "Trillion Peso Rally" na inaasahang magaganap sa Setyembre 21. Ang pagkilos na ito ay bunsod ng galit ng publiko sa umano’y malawakang korapsyon sa mga proyektong flood control. Sa halip na maging solusyon, ang mga proyektong ito ay naging simbolo ng pagnanakaw sa kaban ng bayan. Ang isyung ito, kasama ang iba pang problemang kinakaharap ng bansa, ay nagtutulak sa mga mamamayan—mula sa mga lider ng simbahan, kabataan, hanggang sa ordinaryong mamamayan—na kumilos.
Sa kabila ng iba't ibang pananaw at pinagmulan ng mga lumalahok, ang pagtitipon sa Setyembre 21 ay isang malinaw na pagpapakita ng pagkakaisa. Magkakasama ang iba't ibang sektor—mula sa mga kabataan, mga lider ng simbahan, hanggang sa mga propesyonal at manggagawa—na may iisang layunin: tutulan ang korapsyon. Kahit iba-iba ang kanilang dahilan sa pagdalo, ang sama-samang pagkilos na ito ay nagpapatunay na ang isyu ng katiwalian ay isang sakit na nararamdaman ng lahat, at ang solusyon ay nasa pagiging isa.
Marami ang may pananaw sa mga rally, tinitingnan ito bilang gulo, abala sa trapiko, o aksyon ng mga taong "walang ginagawa." Mayroon ding nagsasabi na ang mga rally ay simpleng gimik lang o walang saysay. Gayunpaman, ang paniniwalang ito ay walang katotohanan, dahil ang pagkilos sa lansangan ay isa sa pinakamahalagang karapatan ng isang mamamayan sa ilalim ng demokrasya. Ito ay isang paraan upang maging bahagi ang publiko sa usapan at direksyon ng bansa.
Bukod pa rito, kahit naging matunog ang panawagan sa social media, marami ang nakakapuna sa kakaibang katahimikan ng ilang tradisyonal na media outlets. Nagdudulot ito ng tanong sa publiko: Sino ang pinoprotektahan ng katahimikang ito? Ang sitwasyong ito ay lalong nagpapalakas sa loob ng mga mamamayan na lumabas at magprotesta dahil alam nilang ang kanilang boses sa lansangan ang magiging pinakamalakas na balita. Ipinapakita nito na kahit pigilin ang balita, ang katotohanan ay lalabas sa pamamagitan ng kolektibong pagkilos.
Maaari nating balikan ang kasaysayan upang makita ang positibong epekto ng mga rally. Ang People Power Revolution noong 1986 ay isang patunay na ang pagkilos ng mamamayan, sa pamamagitan ng mapayapang pagtitipon, ay kayang magpabagsak ng isang diktadura at magbalik ng demokrasya sa bansa. Ipinakita nito na kapag nagkaisa ang mga Pilipino, kayang-kaya nilang baguhin ang takbo ng kasaysayan.
Ang "Trillion Peso March" ay hindi lamang isang simpleng protesta laban sa korapsyon. Ito ay isang panawagan na tumatagos sa kasaysayan, na sumasalamin sa ating patuloy na laban para sa isang gobyernong tapat at isang lipunang makatarungan. Sa halip na pintasan, ating unawain ang halaga ng mga pagkilos na ito. Bawat hakbang, bawat sigaw sa lansangan ay hindi pag-abala, kundi isang matibay na pagpapatunay na ang tapang at pag-asa ng Pilipino ay hindi namamatay. Sa Setyembre 21, muling isigaw ang diwa ng demokrasya—hindi lamang bilang alaala, kundi bilang isang buhay na pangako para sa kinabukasan.

   content: `<p>A line from a book, ‘The Empire of Memory’, by Eric Gamalinda, quotes, "If this government's going to fall, it will fall by the sheer weight of its employees' stupidity."
"I can't believe we're paying these imbeciles real money to do nothing.”
In a country where politicians try to control the narrative, humor slips through the cracks. Satire is no longer a funny joke. It has become something that lingers like a ghost, creeping into our conversations, our feeds, and our daily lives. It is a ghost that sells the truth to millions who are left paying for the failures of those sitting high above.
Political humor is like a live selling content, wherein the products the seller sells are the projects we were told to pay for but it all just went to the lavish lifestyle of the politicians themselves. “Mine! Hingi na rin ako resibo!” But that seems impossible because there was no receipt in the first place. We get promises written on paper, plans drafted in the air, letters to ask for more funds—like a vacuum that quietly sips away the nation’s money.
And yet, people still watch the stream. They laugh at the patter, they type comments, they share the clips. Because even if the products are fake, the satire is real. Humor exposes the emptiness of the shelves, the hollowness of the “items” being sold. In a country drowning in corruption, laughter becomes both coping and resistance. Crocodiles drawn in newspapers utter a giggle to some, proof that in this country even corruption comes with a sense of humor.
Satire is no longer just comedy—it is commentary, a running record of frustration written not in reports but in between jokes. Every meme is a receipt, every parody video a reminder of promises that never turned into projects. In a nation where officials cling to control of the story, satire rewrites it in the people’s voice, louder, funnier, harder to erase.
But laughter can only go so far. For all the jokes that circle our feeds, the corruption they mock remains stubbornly in place. We laugh because it hurts, and we laugh because it is safer than shouting. The question is whether this laughter will ever be enough.
“Bili na kayo! Mga suki kong tax payer!”
In the end, satire can haunt, provoke, and entertain, but it cannot replace action. Humor may keep us alive in the face of absurdity, but it also asks us to decide. Will we keep laughing at the same ghosts, or will we finally lay them to rest?
At some point, the loudest laugh must turn into the loudest demand.

   content: `<p>On September 21, 2025, the Trillion Peso March will take place along Epifanio De Los Santos Avenue (EDSA)  to condemn the mass corruption surrounding flood control projects and the Filipino Government.
Encouragements from the Church Leaders Council for National Transformation (CLCNT) urges fellow Filipinos to make a stance against corruption, with white shirts being the dress code to signify unity and purity for our nation.
“Let us demand accountability, transparent and honest government, and leaders with integrity” a general statement made by the said church council.  
Additionally, the march date marks the 53rd anniversary of the declaration of Martial Law, with organizers describing the rally as a stand of defiance against the persistent abuse of power since the Marcos dictatorship.
Furthermore, the march is set to begin at two in the afternoon with the church council aiming to spread awareness and urge leaders to follow the Lord’s guidance and ensure the safety for the people affected.
“We cannot remain silent while our people wade through floods that could have been prevented if public funds were used honestly. To steal what belongs to the poor is not only a crime against the nation, but a grave sin against God,” according to Bishop Jose Bagaforo of the CLCNT.
March displayed a united wake up call for justice and fairness, a glimpse of a brighter tomorrow for the people.

   content: `<p>On September 14, 2025, students, alumni, and faculty from three FEU campuses unite in TechnoRun at Quirino Grandstand, celebrating health, pride, and unity.
Carrying the theme “A Run for a Healthier FEUture,” this much-awaited event transforms an ordinary Sunday morning into a festival of motion and meaning.  
From the brisk 3K to the demanding 21K, every distance offers a chance not just to run, but to belong.
The first three finishers of the race were awarded special prizes, while the other participants received their corresponding medals and shirts. All runners also took home freebies courtesy of the event’s sponsors.
Francis Indonto, a student from FEU Diliman, secured 3rd place in the 10-kilometer race.
The Virlanie Voices Choir capped the event with a heartfelt performance, serving as the closing highlight of the program.

   content: `<p>Used to hearing coins jingling to cash shuffling, money is the main staple to get by. It didn't feel right to leave the house with no IDs, no cash, and no wallet in our hands. Leaving the house without a wallet felt like stepping into battle without armor. You pat your pocket and realize it’s empty. But in today's digital age, our once bulky leather wallets transition into a click on our phones.
E-Wallet is marking its place in the world of innovation. A software, an electronic device, or an online service that securely stores payment information—such as credit/debit cards, gift cards, loyalty cards, and even tickets or IDs—and enables smooth and fast-paced transactions.
According to the Capital One Shopping team, as of 2024, there are around 4.3 billion digital wallet users globally, covering roughly 52.9% of the world population. By 2024, digital wallet transaction volumes are expected to reach $10 trillion, and by 2029, they are expected to surpass $17 trillion.
Moreover, based on Juniper Research Fintech Magazine, digital wallets are anticipated to overtake standard cards and cash in e-commerce payments beyond 2025. Reshaping daily transactions to more efficient and convenient ways of spending with just a thin click. 
Despite the large amount of users of e-wallets, digital wallets have their weak spots. Like standard wallets, there would be chances of it being snatched. Thieves who obtain card data may add it to their own wallet and continue transactions even after card cancellation. Anything we treasure deserves to be kept secure, in accordance with Investopedia News,  experts recommend enabling transaction alerts, using two-factor authentication, and promptly deregistering lost or compromised cards.
Money comes and goes, but e-wallets stay forever. Where we didn't need to be somewhere with a heavy and loaded pocket, but with just an invisible and light one living on our screens. More so, as per the Capital One Shopping team, global consumers are 165% more likely to use a digital wallet than other online payment methods, for security reasons rather than a dangling wallet.
While not so long, traditional wallets served as a way to hold essential items you would need to go out—cash, coins, cards, and more. No, just picking up from our pockets, our screens have become handy; quietly become a staple passing through everyday life. Every beep, every transfer, every settled bill is not just a test of our adaptation to technology, but of society reinventing money itself, from crumpled paper to accessibility. For millions, cash can now step down; mobile convenience can now reign.

   content: `<p>Just a snap, and everything broke. That's how Thanos did it. One effortless gesture, and half of the universe disappeared—vanished into thin air. Cities went silent, families wept. It was unexpected and shocking how quickly it all ended.
But in reality, it doesn’t take a supernatural force or a cosmic snap to break someone. Sometimes, it’s just one word, one careless action; a joke unnecessary to mention. Some say let words serve as a lesson, but some snap and break in a swift, silent motion.
We often don't hear the crack when it starts. One can still show up, smile, and even play their parts. One can still laugh, reply, and say "I'm fine," even when something or someone has already crossed a line. And that's the painful truth we sometimes forget: some cries for help don't sound like a threat.
Every September 10, the world pauses to observe World Suicide Prevention Day. It is more than just a date marked on the calendar; it is a solemn reminder that every life carries immeasurable worth and that every voice, no matter how quiet or trembling, deserves to be heard. Spearheaded by the International Association for Suicide Prevention and supported by the World Health Organization, this annual commemoration urges humanity to confront one of the most pressing yet often invisible struggles of our time: the silent battles fought in the depths of the human mind. It calls us to recognize that behind even the brightest smiles may lie untold burdens, and within our communities are countless individuals whose pain is hidden beneath layers of silence.
In the context of our country, the theme “Creating Hope Through Action” resonates with particular urgency. Many Filipino students bear responsibilities far beyond the classroom—juggling schoolwork while grappling with financial hardship, familial obligations, and the unyielding pressure to meet society’s lofty expectations. In school corridors, what may seem like ordinary days are often marked by extraordinary struggles. Notebooks, stationeries, gadgets, and much more are not the only things carried from class to class; unspoken worries, private anxieties, and stories too heavy to tell are tucked away in backpacks and hearts. Sometimes, a single gesture can already plant the seed of hope that another day is worth facing. 
Maybe with Thanos, it ends with a snap—a gleam of light which then fades to black. But in this world, it is not that fast. It's a slow unraveling, meant to last. It sometimes starts with silence and missed replies, glances with tired eyes. A food leftover, a laugh gone still, or a fading presence against their will. And when their time comes, there's no rewind; only a glimpse of what's left behind.
The numbers paint a picture of urgency that cannot be ignored. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that nearly 700,000 lives are lost to suicide each year, a devastating figure that translates to one life lost every 40 seconds. In the Philippines, the Department of Health has reported a worrying rise in cases, particularly among the youth. The culprits are familiar yet daunting: the relentless weight of academic pressure, the challenges born of poverty, and the heavy stigma that still cloaks the act of seeking help. But these are not merely statistics on a page. Behind every digit is a name, a face, a dream—a classmate whose laughter once filled the room, a neighbor who once shared stories by the gate, a friend whose potential was cut short before it had the chance to flourish.
Yet we must remember: numbers do not dictate destiny. Suicide is preventable if we, as a community, choose to respond with compassion, awareness, and courage. Warning signs—withdrawal from peers, sudden mood swings, words laced with hopelessness—must never be dismissed as mere drama or temporary phases. They are signals, often desperate, that intervention is needed and empathy must replace apathy. Especially in schools, where mistakes can feel magnified and expectations unrelenting, cultivating safe spaces for open and honest conversations is not optional; it is essential.
Just a snap, and everything broke. That's how it started, but now we are woke. This isn't made-up; we're not on screen. We can't undo what we've already seen. Still, we are not helpless or out of time, because sometimes healing starts with a single line. A word of kindness or a message sent; a sign to show that it's not the end. If one word can hurt, another can save, because one small act can make someone brave. So speak with care, be present, be near—you just might be the voice they need to hear.

   content: `<p>If you grew wings, where would you fly to? 
Is it somewhere that is filled with people not easy to break at the slightest reprimand, walkable pavements that do not reek the smell of uproar and urine; or even somewhere that is free from housing flood amid heavy rains?
Or do you know your place too well, too much—enough for you to be satisfied and to settle down?
The thing is—most know where to go, just not when to go. The home that houses their physical being, their body, but never their soul. The soul that may have been seeking relief from all the stressors but may have never given the chance.
But were they ever truly given the chance?
There are some jobs that offer a taste, or a tease to set one’s foot in the soil of their dream place. Namely, call center agents that its workplaces are nestled in the heart of the city they fantasize about. Corporate workers that work at their dream destination despite the worse traffic conditions every day. Most especially, the drivers of different public transportations that cradles the nation’s workforce at their backs.
Then, the radio spoke: The Institute for  Occupational Health and Safety Development (IOHSAD) condemns the ‘unlimited working hours’ of drivers, calling it systemic neglect that endangers public safety, exploits drivers, and violates basic labor rights. 
But one man, a taxi driver—jolts awake from the noise of the radio. His hazy eyes tried to make sense of all the bright, red lights that surrounded his car. He learned that he was still stuck in traffic, and the fact that it was past 4 in the morning. Hastily picking up the phone, he swiped to get rid of the itch of boredom.
There, his eyes feast upon endless posts on Senate hearings, flood control, Marie Evangelista Antoinette, and…
Nepo babies? It was the internet’s new cause of rage, rightfully so. Though a greater issue for him was that as he drove by further down the avenue, the car started to gradually sink due to the flood. The water has an impressive shade of brown, some recyclable junk floats here-and-there; even a person swam across briefly within the frame of his glasses. 
He felt ticked off, similar to the feeling of when one bites on an eggshell when eating their omelette; or even when the instant, overpriced coffee tastes nothing but water, yet does not dare to bring it up. That is, having to face the nation’s suffering yet forced to suck and swallow. More so, feeling powerless; exerting more focus on attempting to earn a living.
The streets itself is how he, the taxi driver, makes a living. It is not meant for chaotic parades, a display of one’s decadent, yet stolen wealth—or even creating a dam simulation on the roads itself. 
A dam-ned situation that is, to bear a sight of cries and woes from Filipinos that shed sweat and blood, just for those who think they run a monarchy, suck their hard-earned earnings dry. To have people cramming themselves in the MRT trains like sardines who wore bags, as well as some having to crawl out of their so-called home ‘underground sewage systems’.
The taxi driver decided to pick up one last passenger before heading home to rest. It was 4 in the morning, and he saw a woman hailing for a taxi doing a ‘thumbs up’. So, he stopped the car and she went in. 
TO BGC. The woman, veiled in well-known lavish brands, spoke gently. BGC, he admittedly says, still remains an unfamiliar place to him. A place out of his league. Yet he strikes back saying that if he had wings, he would certainly migrate his family and live there. Though to make money, he would display and make an art out of himself and his wings, as he believes that wealthy people buy anything that strikes them as odd. Literally and figuratively.
One article from Inquirer.net reports Malacañang’s findings on the suspicious flood control projects turned ‘ghost projects’. Turns out, the nation has spent PHP 545.64 billion on 9,855 flood control projects for over 2 years and 10 months.
As the taxi driver narrated his experience scrolling on different social media platforms; seeing those posts on corruption, senate hearings, even the different memes—the woman remained silent in the backseat. He noticed, and while his mouth remained close together, his eyes wandered around her. All those university books in his hand, the phone she held tight that cost half a hundred thousand pesos, the luxurious bag that’s price obnoxiously increases annually.
For him, she is a sight to see. She is enveloped in opportunities that were a bit too hard to reach at the end of the ladder. And at the end of the ladder, the water level kept on increasing. The social status was as if we were placed in a barrel that had a ladder for the people to climb out, and the water gradually started settling in the bottom. It was neglect that will cost their lives. But what is atop of the barrel?
As they got nearer to the destination, the water gradually started emptying. Going lower and lower, as eventually–there was no more sight of flood. The taxi driver could not help but heave out a sigh of pleasure. He felt as if every mile they achieved nearer to the destination, the wings coordinated and blossomed out of his back. 
The sight is breathtaking. From the overall urban and sleek designs of the towering buildings, to the walkable pavements with an organized street grid—the wings on his back fully expanded, and felt the itch to fly away and start a new life.
Finally, they have reached their destination. How much is the fare? She asked.
He goes, Please pay me how much you like. This, thinking that from her lavish appearance, she could afford to pay with a big and unusual tip. Name your price, she goes.
But he responds in a gentle manner, please, pay whatever amount you wish. That is, subtly cracking a smile on his face.
Then, she reaches for her wallet, gives the money to the taxi driver and exits out of the car. With a smile, he opens his tightly closed palm to see how much she had paid: PHP 150. He broke into a laugh. He did not know if he was laughing because of the way he foolishly set himself up for this, or it was because he had lost his wings and it was already 8 in the morning. 
Either way, it was time for him to go get some rest as this did not feel like his home. So, he pocketed his hard-earned money, then eyeing the place for some local karinderya to feed his starving family that awaits for him home.

   content: `<p>On Monday, September 1, 2025, Sarah Discaya’s nine construction firms were revoked of licenses by the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB), during the probe of the senate hearing on the blue ribbon committee. 
The nine companies linked to Discaya ranked among the 15 largest construction companies who received a disproportionately large share of flood-control project allocations between 2022 and 2025. 
Notably, Alpha and Gen. Contractor & Development Corp. (AOGCD)—a firm under Discaya’s portfolio, secured roughly ₱7.3 billion in contracts for 103 flood-control projects as of July 2022.
“After thorough evaluation of the statements made by Ms. Discaya, the PCAB Board concludes that the continued accreditation of these corporations is inimical to public interest, industry integrity and government procurement transparency,” said PCAB. 
Furthermore, Senator Bato Dela Rosa asked about the initial year of Discaya’s joint effort with the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) regarding flood-control projects. 
“2016 onwards," Discaya revealed. 
Discaya’s confession left Bato to be momentarily speechless, caught off-guard by the revelation that the partnership began under the Duterte administration.
The next Senate hearing is set for September 8, with expectations that the two previously absent contractors, now facing arrest warrants for noncompliance, will finally appear.

   content: `<p>Sa isang silid-aralan, tahimik na nakaupo si Nena, siya ay nasa ika-11 na baitang. Habang malinaw ang pagbasa ng mga kaklase niya, siya ay nakatitig lamang sa pisara. Ang mga titik ay tila malabong ulap sa kaniyang mga mata, hindi mawari kung saan magsisimula. Ang guro, bagamat may mabuting layunin, ay minsang nagmamadaling itulak ang mga estudyante na makahabol, dagdag na bigat sa pusong hindi kayang ibalewala. Habang ang ilan ay abala sa mga pahina, siya ay unti-unting nababalot sa hiya, wari’y bihag ng mga letrang hindi niya makilala.
Ngunit si Nena ay hindi nag-iisa. Sa iba’t ibang sulok ng bansa, libu-libong kabataan ang may parehong bigat na dala-dala. Hindi dahil sa dami ng gawain, kundi sa bigat ng mga salitang hirap siyang alamin. Bagamat mataas ang kanilang baitang, ang bawat letra’t talata’y tila nakasarang pintuan, hindi nila mabuksan at pasukin ang daan tungo sa kaalaman. Habang ang ilan ay nakaiintindi sa paaralan, sila ay nananatiling bihag ng katahimikan. 
Hindi ito kuwento lamang ng iisang bata, kundi ito ay tumatayong representasyon ng isang henerasyong naiwan, ang pagbasa at pagsulat ay nananatiling lihim sa kanilang isipan.
Ngayong Setyembre 8, sama-sama ang mundo sa paggunita ng International Literacy Day. Isang araw na sinimulan pa noong 1967 ng United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) bilang paalala sa kahalagahan ng literasiya sa pagtataguyod ng isang lipunang makatarungan at mapayapa. Ngayon, sa temang “Promoting Literacy in the Digital Era,” tinututukan ang bagong mukha ng literasiya na hindi lamang sa pagbasa at pagsulat, kundi ang kakayahang maunawaan, suriin, lumikha, at makipag-ugnayan ng digital na literasiya ng ligtas at may kritikal na pag-iisip.
Sa kabilang banda, hindi pa rin nawawala ang hamon. Humigit-kumulang 739 milyong kabataan at matatanda sa buong mundo ang kulang pa rin sa batayang kasanayan sa pagbabasa at pagsulat. 
Apat sa sampung bata ang hindi naaabot ang minimum na antas ng kahusayan, at may 272 milyong kabataan ang hindi nakapasok sa paaralan noong 2023. 
Pinapaalala ng pagdiriwang na ito na ang mga oportunidad na dulot ng teknolohiya ay walang saysay kung maraming Pilipino pa rin ang naiwan sa dilim—tulad ni Nena.
Sa bawat titik na hindi mabasa, may pangarap na naantala. Sa bawat salitang hindi maisulat, may tinig na hindi naririnig sa lipunan. Ang literasiya ay hindi luho kundi karapatan, hindi opsyon kundi daan—hinding-hindi dapat maging pribilehiyo ng iilan. Kung ang kaalaman ay susi sa kinabukasan, paano makatatawid ang libu-libong taong tulad ni Nena, kung ang pinto ng pagbabasa ay nananatiling nakasara? 
Sa pagdiriwang ng International Literacy Day, nawa’y hindi lang pagdiriwang kundi panawagan—na sa digital na panahon, walang batang mapag-iiwanan. Kung gayon, ang pagbasa at pagsulat sana’y maging ilaw ng lahat, at hindi tanong na walang kasagutan.
Sa piling ni Nena, makikita ang mukha ng estadistika. Hindi siya bilang lang sa tala, kundi buhay na sumisigaw ng pag-asa. Habang ang mundo’y nagbibilang ng milyon-milyong hirap sa pagbabasa, kabilang si Nena sa mga batang mataas na ang baitang, ngunit nananatiling bihag ng mga letra. Habang digital ang usapan at tablet ang gamit ng iba, hawak pa rin niya ang lapis, tila walang saysay dahil ang pag-unawa’y naantala.
Sa bawat hiya sa harap ng letrang hindi matunton, walang batang dapat maiwan; lahat ay may karapatan sa edukasyon. Sa bawat titik at salita, kaalaman ay napayayaman, at ito’y nagiging susi sa magandang kinabukasan. Si Nena ay isang paalala na ang literasiya ay hindi numero lamang, kundi kuwento ng bawat Pilipinong nais bumangon mula sa kamangmangan.

   content: `<p>Sa bawat kamay na umaabot, hindi lang ang yakap ng tulong ang sumasapit, kasama rin ang himaymay ng pagkatao. Hindi ang materyal ang iyong naibibigay, kundi ang busilak ng puso at kalooban.
Ang pagbibigay ay hindi nakatali sa kundisyon, hindi ito nakapalibot sa pangakong may babalik. Isa itong pagpaparamdam na may dalang kumot ang sinag ng umaga para sa’yo, isang liwanag na sumasalubong sa madilim ng gabi.
Mabagal man ang pag-ikot ng panahon, hindi humuhupa ang pagkilos na ipinagdiriwang tuwing World Charity Day. Sa araw na ito, hindi lamang mga kamay ang inaabot, kundi buong sarili na naglalakbay patungo sa nangangailangan.
At kahit na may ilan na ang pag-abot ay nakakadena sa kapalit, nananatiling buhay at malaya ang diwa ng pag-aalay na siyang sentro ng araw na ito. Ang ilaw na gumagabay sa bawat hakbang ni Mother Teresa ay hindi nakikita sa mga bagay na maaaring hawakan, kundi nagmumula sa pinakaloob ng pagkatao.
Sa kanya sumilang ang diwa na ngayo’y isinusulong ng World Charity Day. Kung ang kabutihan ay maaaring makita, maramdaman, at marinig, ito’y matatagpuan sa bawat hakbang at haplos ni Mother Teresa. Sa kanyang mga kamay dumaloy ang haplos na nagpagaling hindi lamang ng sugat kundi pati ng damdamin, sa kanyang mga braso nakatagpo ng kanlungan ang mga iniwan ng lipunan, at sa kanyang tinig muling sumibol ang pag-asa sa mga pusong matagal nang pinatahimik ng lungkot. Ang pagbibigay ay hindi basta kilos, ito’y salamin ng puso at kaluluwa.

   content: `<p>It is a known fact that a river can run but never walk, has a mouth but never talks, and has a head but never weeps. But in the Philippines, the river can flood, the only difference is that it flows trash, its mouth swallows the entire streets, and the weeps are coming from the Filipino people.
With each seasonal rainy season in the Philippines from June to November, it is now expected that every year, instead of festivals, we expect flooded cities, so much so that it is now called the “new normal." With this new normal, the government is trying its bare minimum to solve the current situation at hand, as its so-called flood control project shows an unbelievable budget put out with its transparency. 
Treat it as an irony, but the waters aren’t the only thing rising here, but also the corruption. According to Former DPWH Secretary Rogelio “Babes” Singson and General Appropriations Act, Senator Panfilo “Ping” Lacson, the budget for the year 2022 was from ₱128 billion in 2022 to nearly ₱248 billion this year. The flood control budget has ballooned, yet floods remain. Former Public Works Secretary Rogelio Singson said that it all came down to dredging (the act of removing materials such as sediments and trash from bodies of water).
But is the cost of this act too much to bear? The answer is no. The truth is, they schedule to do dredging when it’s raining, making the results of the project impossible to check, as Former Commission on Audit (COA) Commissioner Heidi Mendoza stated during her tenure. 
This leads to the main suspect of where all of the budget goes—corruption. All of this wasn’t a misunderstanding on the breakdown of the expenses; it’s a scheme. A scheme that is obvious enough, ₱545.64 billion was spent on 9,855 projects, yet 6,021 projects worth ₱350 billion with no breakdown of the expenses. A scheme that is obvious enough, we’re still blinded by the truth that the real suspect is in front of us, causing the flood that has haunted us for years.
However, the blind weren’t blind for long, as the anger of the Filipino people erupted in July and August 2025 with a bicameral conference on the dark truth behind flood control programs, which had a ₱142-billion insertion in the 2025 national budget. But corruption doesn’t just flood our streets with water—it floods privilege into the lives of those born into power. Nepotism—or the rise of “nepo babies”—finds its way even into infrastructure.
Nepo babies, also known as Nepotism babies is a person who gains success or opportunities through familial connections. Now, how does this connect to the flood control project and specifically corruption? Well, one particular influencer known as Claudine Co, the daughter of Christopher Co, owner of Hi-Tone Construction & Development Corporation, and niece of Ako Bicol Representative Zaldy Co, the co-founder of Sunwest Incorporated, has been making lavish day-in-a-life vlogs featuring riding a private plane to La Union, wearing an expensive dress that cost more than ₱170,000, and more costly trips. These corporations rank among Malacañang’s top 15 contractors for flood control projects.
Claudine Co isn’t alone on the ‘nepo baby list.’ More influencers are being called out—raising the question: why is corruption so easy to get away with when it stares us in the face? The highways, the small potholes on the streets, the sewers, the education system, healthcare, and more are a must that we call out. We’re the taxpayers, the ones who fight through our lives fairly and expect good governance throughout our deeds, but we got exploited instead by those who sit in power. Flood control projects cry us a river—literally. Despite heavy budgets, streets still drown in the same problems, pointing to loopholes in how projects are planned and monitored.
Through this, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos will be implementing a lifestyle check, which shows the financial breakdowns of multibillion-peso projects. Hopefully, it will bloom a government where transparency isn’t treated as distrust by them, a government that shows the Filipino people what they deserve—good governance. We are not the people who need to be sympathized with by our resilience, but the people who need to speak and know how powerful democracy is. We should not be rivers with mouths that never speak. We must be the flood that drowns corruption—with accountability.

Binatikos ng pangulo ang ilang opisyal na umano’y kumikita mula sa bilyon-bilyong pondo na nakalaan para masolusyunan ang problema sa pagbaha.
“Kamakailan lang, nag-inspeksyon ako sa naging epekto ng habagat at bagyong Crising, Dante at Emong. Kitang-kita ko, [na] maraming proyekto sa flood control [ang] mga palpak at 'yung iba, guni-guni lang." pahayag ni Marcos sa kanyang talumpati.
“Kaya sa mga nakikipagsabwatan upang kunin ang pondo ng bayan at nakawin ang kinabukasan ng ating mamamayan, mahiya naman kayo sa inyong kapwa Pilipino.” dagdag pa niya.
Kasunod nito, inatasan niya ang Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) na magsumite ng kumpletong talaan sa lahat ng flood control projects sa nakalipas na tatlong taon.
“We will publish this list so that the public can see it. Sa mga susunod na buwan, makakasuhan ang mga lalabas na may sala mula sa imbestigasyon pati na ang [mga] kontrasista sa buong bansa. Kailangan malaman ng taumbayan ang katotohanan, kailangan may managot sa matinding pinsala sa katiwalian.” ayon pa sa Pangulo.
Tinatayang nasa bilyon-bilyong pera ang taunang inilalabas na pondo para sa mga flood control projects.

   content: `<p>Every August 30, the Philippines marks National Press Freedom Day to honor Marcelo H. del Pilar, the Father of Philippine Journalism, the man whose words once pierced the silence of tyranny and lit the fire of a people longing for freedom. His pen was not merely ink on paper; it was a torch, a weapon, a call to arms. And today, more than a century later, his legacy reminds us of a truth both timeless and terrifying: the battle for press freedom is never over.
To guard press freedom is to guard democracy itself. But our history bleeds with reminders of what happens when truth-tellers are silenced. Nearly two hundred journalists have been murdered since the fall of dictatorship in 1986, their cases left to rot in courtrooms, their voices erased, their courage met with bullets. The Global Impunity Index continues to shame our nation, ranking us among the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists. This is a grim testimony to how fragile our freedoms remain.
And yet, not all weapons against the press are fired from a gun. Threats today arrive wearing new masks: lawsuits designed to drain the spirit, arrests built on shaky charges, smear campaigns branding watchdogs as enemies of the state. Online, armies of trolls swarm in coordinated attacks. Offline, red-tagging has become a normalized curse, painting truth-tellers as traitors. Violence has not disappeared; it has evolved. And in the last three years alone, watchdogs have recorded a surge in harassment, proving that while the battlefield may shift, the war against truth continues.
National Press Freedom Day must not wither into tokenism. It cannot be reduced to ceremonial wreaths and empty declarations. It is a summons to vigilance, a demand for accountability, a reminder that rights are never permanent. They survive only if defended. To honor del Pilar is not to remember him with silence, but to fight with the same fire: the fire carried now by journalists who risk their lives daily to tell the stories that power wishes to bury, and by citizens who refuse to mistake silence for peace.
For press freedom is not the privilege of the press alone. It belongs to the people. It is the right to know, the power to question, the shield against tyranny, the mirror of accountability. To let it die is to strip ourselves bare of every liberty we claim to hold.
Today is not a day for passive remembrance. It is a day for resolve. Protect the storytellers. Defend the truth. Stand guard over the freedoms bought with the lives of those who came before. Because when the press is gagged, the nation is blinded. When the truth is silenced, freedom is consigned.

   content: `<p>The Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) issued a reminder regarding fire precautions through a seminar held for the Senior High School Tamaraws at Far Eastern University-Diliman (FEU-D) held at the MPR Annex on Friday, August 29. 
Fire Officer 1 (FO1) Divinah A. Espanto acted as the main speaker for the event, together with FO2 Enrick John B. Teodoro, and Team Leader FO3 Ryan Dollesin. 
FO1 Espanto initiated the discussion by defining terms related to fire safety and taught the audience a necessary lecture for fire extinguisher usages. 
During the presentation, an important mnemonic was introduced to determine the correct types of fire extinguishers to avoid misuse. 
Notably, the A.B.C. and K. mnemonic stands for Ash, Boiling, Current, and Kitchen, which determines the correct fire extinguisher to use according to the sources of fire. 
FO3 Dollesin and FO1 Espanto spoke about the importance of school preparedness for unexpected disasters such as a fire outbreak.
“Sinisigurado naman naming kapag naturuan namin sila sa fire drill eh maturuan sa paggamit ng fire extinguisher, lalo na’t importante yung pagring ng fire alarm.” Dollesin said in the post-discussion interview.
“The students were very cooperative, but we still make sure that we take every drill seriously because we never know baka serious na rin pala yung nangyayari.” Espanto added. 
The seminar ended successfully with a photo-op with the invited BFP speakers together with the audiences, also leaving their contact number, “0976-550-0326” for emergency purposes.

   content: `<p>The Senior High School (SHS) students of Far Eastern University—Diliman actively participated in their annual fire drill held at the Open Court on Friday, August 29.
The drill is conducted in coordination with the school’s Safety and Security Office and local fire authorities, aimed to strengthen students’ preparedness and awareness in case of fire.
In line with this, it simulated a fire emergency, where the school bell served as the signal for evacuation. 
Within minutes, students promptly evacuated their classrooms and headed towards the Open court in their designated assembly area.
Teachers and the school staff were present to assist and oversee the smooth and safe flow of the drill.
During this drill, some students volunteered to participate in extinguishing the fire from a fire pot using fire extinguishers, with the assistance of members of the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP).
This annual fire drill is part of FEU Diliman’s continuing initiatives on disaster risk reduction and management, ensuring that its students are ready and resilient in any emergency situation.

   content: `<p>Midway through the first semester, the Far Eastern University-Diliman (FEU-D) administered the Asian Psychological Services Assessment (APSA) pre-test to assess Senior High School Tamaraws’ proficiency for A.Y. 2025–2026 on Wednesday, August 27.
Specifically, the diagnostic assessment measured student competency level in core academic subjects of Science, English, and Mathematics for both Grade 11 and Grade 12.
As per the usual Wednesday schedule, Grade 11 Tamaraws took the APSA from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, while Grade 12 Tamaraws completed theirs from 12:30 to 4:30 p.m., each in their respective rooms.
Throughout the four-hour schedule, class advisers supervised the pre-test, which allotted half an hour for orientation, an hour each for Science and English, included a 30-minute break, and ended with Mathematics as the final subject.
With the APSA pre-test conducted in the opening semester, the post-test is expected before the second semester of the SHS ends to fully evaluate students’ progress on both assessments.

   content: `<p>"Ang mamatay nang dahil sa’yo." Ito ang huling linya ng ating pambansang awit. Paulit-ulit natin itong inaawit, ngunit minsan lang natin pinagninilayan. Kapag naririnig natin ang salitang sakripisyo, madalas itong iniuugnay sa pag-aalay ng buhay para sa isang tao o bayan. Ngunit, ang mismong linya ay nagmumungkahi ng higit pa—isang pagkakaiba sa pagitan ng “para sa’yo” at “dahil sa’yo.”
Ito ay may pagkakaiba, kung pagtutuunan ng pansin—ang ‘para sa’yo’ ay aksyon, pero ang ‘dahil sa’yo’ ay dahilan. Ang ‘para sa’yo’ ay malinaw at tuwiran—isang sakripisyong may malinaw na layunin: ang ipagtanggol, iligtas, at ang mahalin ka hanggang sa huli. Pero ang ‘dahil sa’yo’ ay mas malawak at mas mabigat.
Hindi lang ito tungkol sa aksyong ginawa, kundi sa mismong dahilan kung bakit ‘yon ginawa. Ito ay may matibay na paninindigan—may pagmamahal, tapang, at dangal.
Tuwing Araw ng mga Bayani, inaalala natin ang mga kilala sa kasaysayan, ang mga nagbuwis ng buhay upang ipagtanggol ang ating kalayaan. Ngunit sa araw ng mga bayani, kasama rin ang mga bayani ng ating panahon ngayon: mga guro na patuloy magturo sa kabila ng sakuna, mga manggagamot na pumapasok sa ospital sa gitna ng mga panganib, at mga mamamahayag na naghahatid ng katotohanan, kahit ang kapalit ay ang mga pagbabanta sa kanilang buhay. 
Hindi man sila laging nakikita sa pahina ng kasaysayan, pero hawak nila ang parehong puso at panata na dala ng mga bayani noon.
At sa bawat isa sa atin na patuloy pumipili ng kabutihan sa gitna ng ordinaryong araw—sa guro, manggagamot, mamamahayag, at kahit sa simpleng mamamayang nagmamalasakit—dala-dala natin ang panatang ito: ang magsakripisyo, maglingkod, at magmahal ng bayan kahit walang kapalit na palakpak.
At sa tuwing pinipili natin ang kabutihan, pinatitibay natin ang isang panata—hindi lang para sa bayan, kundi dahil sa bayan.

   content: `<p>Sa gitna ng mga naglalakihang gusali at magugulong kalye ng pinakamalaking siyudad sa Metro Manila, nananatiling buhay ang isang munting hangarin.
"Nais kong magkaroon ng isang kabisera na siyang magiging punong tanggapan ng pambansang gobyerno—isang lugar na magiging respetadong sentro ng buhay, mga ambisyon, at tagumpay ng tao, habang ito ay isang masiglang komunidad na kayang magtaguyod ng sarili nito.”
Para sa iba, ang pahayag na ito ay tila simpleng mensahe na walang nilalaman; walang bigat, walang katotohanan.
Subalit sa taong 1939, nang umusbong ang bagong republika at nahirapan ang siksikang Maynila na sumagot sa mga tumitinding pangangailangan ng mga mamamayan, nagkaroon ng timbang ang bawat salitang nabitawan. 
At bilang marangal na pinuno, pinatunayan ni Manuel L. Quezon na ang kanyang talumpati ay hindi lamang  pangarap na nakabitin sa hangin, kundi tapat na pangakong maitataga sa bato. Pangako na hindi niya man natuklasan nang lubos sa kanyang panahon, ngunit patuloy na nabubuhay sa bawat sulok ng komunidad na nagdadala ng kanyang pangalan.
Ngunit sino nga ba siya?
Higit pa sa pagiging Ama ng Wikang Pambansa, si Quezon ang ikalawang pangulo ng Pilipinas na namamuno mula 1935 hanggang sa kanyang huling hininga noong 1944. Siya ang taong naglatag ng daan tungo sa kalayaan ng bayan. Sa kanyang pagtatayo ng panibagong lungsod, nais niyang bigyang-solusyon ang mga suliranin na bumubuhat sa kaguluhan ng dating Maynila.
Sa pamamagitan ng mga proyektong pabahay para sa mga mamamayan at sa pagtatayo ng mga imprastrakturang sumasalamin sa isang umuunlad na bansa, unti-unti niyang sinimulan ang pagbubuti ng pangkalahatang estado ng Pilipinas na noon ay nasa bingit ng kasarinlan. 
Bagaman hindi na kabisera ang Quezon sa kasalukuyan at marahil naglaho na sa alaala ng mga residente ang tunay na kasaysayan ng kanilang kinaroroonan, sila ay mahalagang kasangkapan pa rin sa patuloy na pagtupad sa adhikain ng dating pangulo. 
Kaya't upang parangalan ang ugat ng isang masaganang pamayanan, ipinagdiriwang natin ang Araw ng Quezon City sa kapanganakan ng bayaning ang pangalan ay bitbit ng buong lungsod tuwing Ika-18 ng Agosto.
Sa araw na ito, hindi lamang natin ginagalang ang nakaraan, ipinagbubunyi rin natin ang patunay na ang mga pangarap, kapag bininyagan ng pawis at determinasyon, ay nagiging katotohanan. 
Sa huli, ang tunay na tagumpay ni Quezon ay hindi matutuklasan sa anumang gusali o kalye, kundi sa mga taong patuloy na naniniwala na ang munting hangarin ay maaaring maging malaking pagbabago.

    content: `<p>In a span of only one school year, what began as a modest collective of young journalists evolved into a rising vanguard of truth-seeking and principled storytelling. The Innovator Jr., Far Eastern University Diliman’s official publication, has charted a bold path from its humble beginnings to becoming one of the most recognized contenders in campus journalism.
The journey commenced at the Association of Private Schools Administrators, Inc. (APSA) First Writing Contest held on October 18. Competing among 22 schools across Quezon City, FEU Diliman was heralded as the 4th Top Performing School overall and the 3rd Top Performing School in the Filipino category. A total of 16 students across junior and senior high school received distinctions for their prowess in various individual events. This triumph marked the university’s first-ever journalism trophies—setting into motion a legacy not merely of accolades, but of purpose-driven reporting and peerless commitment to craft.
The momentum surged forward in November during the District VI Secondary Schools Press Conference (DSSPC), where FEU Diliman made an indelible impression. Across both English and Filipino categories, the campus journalists collectively garnered 20 individual medals. These were complemented by commendable feats in the Collaborative Desktop Publishing (CDP) contests. In the Filipino category, the publication secured first runner-up, alongside multiple awards in news, opinion, feature, sports layout, and visual design. The English CDP team also achieved 2nd runner-up for its opinion page. Through both written word and visual composition, these results spoke volumes about the publication’s depth, range, and disciplined preparation.
Following this, the Division Schools Press Conference (DSPC) became another historic milestone. FEU Diliman ranked 6th overall among 52 participating schools and placed 4th in the English category, with 12 students securing awards across various genres. Notably, The Innovator Jr. earned 4th place in Feature Page, 7th in News Page, 8th in both Editorial and Sci-Tech Pages, and 10th in Sports Page. Aghimuan, its Filipino counterpart, earned 4th place in Best School Publication, with distinctions such as 1st in News Page, 2nd in Sports Page, and 9th in Best Layout. Notably, the Filipino CDP team secured 4th place, once again proving the power of collective output in visual journalism.
With the turning of the year came another milestone. At the Regional Schools Press Conference (RSPC), The Innovator Jr. once again defied the odds. Among schools across the National Capital Region, it secured 9th place in the Editorial Section—English Secondary Category. A team that only months prior had not existed on any official roster was now making its mark across regional platforms, staking its claim in the larger narrative of campus journalism. And in a landmark triumph for the school, two student journalists from FEU Diliman had also qualified for the Regional Schools Press Conference, affirming the institution’s emergence not just as a contender at the regional level, but as a force in the Philippine campus press.
Yet, beyond the victories and medals, the true achievement lies in the culture The Innovator Jr. has cultivated—a culture of precision, of discernment, of writing not merely for accolades but for impact. The members did not merely train to compete; they trained to question, to verify, to narrate with integrity. What glues this collective together is not just talent, but the understanding that every headline must serve clarity and every article must echo truth.
But achievements cannot be measured by medals, trophies, and certificates alone. The Innovator Jr. spent the school year not only competing, but covering. The publication thrived in its role as an anchor of student voice as it successfully covered pivotal events such as SigTalkas, Sportsfest, Foundation Week, and more, ensuring that institutional memory is not only preserved but documented with substance and clarity. Each article serves as a mirror, reflecting the pulse of the campus while upholding its motto: Our voices shall unite through ink and insight.
The school year 2024 to 2025 is not just a record of awards. It is a chronicle of endurance and ambition, of student journalists stepping into the responsibilities of public discourse. From the first byline to the latest headline, The Innovator Jr. has not only highlighted milestones—it has created them.
And as the ink dries on this transformative year, one thing is clear: the story of The Innovator Jr. is only just beginning. The names may change, the staff may turn over, but the standard has been set—unyielding, unflinching, and unmistakably bold.
The pen remains in steady hands. History, it seems, has found new authors.

    content: `<p>The University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman held the 2025 Pride PH Festival, titled “Love Laban,” on June 28 in celebration of International Pride Day.
Pride Expo booths were set up first thing at 10 a.m., with different vendors, sponsors, and organizations.
The official pride march started at 3 p.m. from the UP Oblation Plaza along C.P. Garcia Avenue, Katipunan Avenue, Roxas Avenue, and Osmeña Avenue, ending at the UP Sunken Garden.
Organizers communicated with local authorities for temporary road closures and informed the participants through social media to give way to the march.
The participants had placards, banners, and flags and wore colorful outfits, all calling out for equality, justice, and LGBTQIA+ rights.
Prior to the event, organizers had informed attendees about possible rain, which began to pour just as Pride Night, the evening performance program, started.
Despite the heavy rain and muddy grounds, the event continued with high spirits, loud cheers, and unwavering pride.
Pride Night lasted until midnight, featuring a variety of bands, singers, drag artists, dance crews, and special guest idols.
The event concluded with a message of resistance, unity, and celebration of queer identity, closing out Love Laban 2025 with joy and pride.</p>`,

    content: `<p>The river never asked to be poured all the way to the sea, yet it settled there unapologetically. The trees never asked to grow this tall. It never asked to bear fruit, leaves, and flowers. But even so, we sleep peacefully at night, never wondering why things are what they are. Why don't people find it baffling how we put things in our system only to dispose of them into a ceramic bowl intently? The way the most uncanny creatures exist never seemed to bother society. They're all raging about how a woman should act, how a man should act, and how love is supposed to be, never about the things that actually matter—hunger, poverty, politics, and war.
The ocean appears blue even if water is transparent, the tide is sometimes high and sometimes low. Even if you don't seem masculine enough, you can still call yourself a man. If you're too masculine, you're still allowed to be a woman. 
After the storm, there comes a rainbow. You don't need to figure it all out in one night; even flowers can't bloom that fast. And just like the rainbow, though the colors are named, it's still a very broad spectrum. Why put yourself into one color when there's a whole gradient to pick? Your identity, much like the colors of the rainbow, doesn't have to be just one thing. Nature doesn't think of it that way, it never has.
This vastness, this spectrum, is comparable to a whole galaxy. You're a star as yourself as well, even if some of you are still hiding, only seen when it's nighttime. Despite that, you're still shining. Everyone wants to reach for a star like you, though the most they could do is to watch from afar. The others would rather see the sun than your starlight, but it shouldn't dim your light.
Has the world made space for you yet? It shouldn't be that way. Be just how you are and make space for them instead. There's no harm in staying true, especially if what you're doing is just inevitable.
So, before it ends, greet your TWINKling friends a Happy Pride Month!</p>`,

Whether you're a dad, stepdad, grandpa, or a father figure, your presence impacts lives in ways words can never fully capture. Your love, strength, and quiet sacrifices do not go unnoticed. You are deeply appreciated and deserve to be celebrated.
You may not wear a cape, but in the eyes that look up to you—you've always been a hero.
You may not ask for praise, but you deserve all of it, and more.

Ang pambansang bandila ay ang nagsilbing instrumento upang ideklara ang pagkakatayo ng Unang Republika ng Pilipinas at ang pagkahanap ng liwanag mula sa madilim na mahigit tatlong daan taong pamamahala ng Espanya.
Hanggang sa kasalukuyan, ang tila ordinaryong pangyayaring ito ay nananatiling sagisag ng walang-sawang pagpupunyagi upang makamit at mapanatili ang demokrasya at mga karapatang sibil na dapat tamasahin ng bawat Pilipino.
Bukod sa taunang pagdiriwang na nagdadala ng pag-asa sa ating mga puso, nararapat nating ipagpatuloy ang paggugunita at pag-alala sa mga bayaning naging pundasyon ng kalayaang ating tinatamasa ngayon.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Picture yourself being asked to give up something you love most. No explanation. No guarantees. Just faith.
That is what Eid al-Adha quietly asks us to remember.
This sacred day, honored by Muslims around the world, goes back to the story of Prophet Ibrahim—who was willing to sacrifice his son in obedience to Allah. In the end, his son was spared, and a ram was offered instead. The real test wasn’t about loss. It was about trust.
The celebration continues with prayer, reflection, and food sharing. In Muslim communities across the Philippines, especially in Mindanao, the day is marked by quiet gatherings, generous meals, and acts of kindness toward those in need.
It is not loud. It is not showy. But it is deeply powerful.
Because sometimes, the strongest faith is shown in silence—in quiet acts of obedience, in sacrifices no one else sees.
Eid al-Adha reminds us that faith often lies in the quiet moments, rather than in the spotlight. It whispers to us, and when silence meets faith, something truly sacred unfolds—even in the unseen places.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Muling huhusgahan ng kasaysayan ang sambayanang Pilipino sa Mayo 12, 2025. Higit 75.9 milyong mamamayan ang boboto para sa mahigit 18,000 posisyon sa pamahalaang lokal at nasyonal. Isang araw ito kung saan ang ganap na kapangyarihan ay nasa sambayanan. Isang araw na maaaring maging simula ng pag-angat, o tuluyang pagbagsak. Ngunit sa bawat halalan, tila mas nangingibabaw ang ingay kaysa diwa, ang sikat kaysa may kakayahan, at ang mga salitang mabulaklak kaysa sa platapormang makabuluhan. Kaya tayo ay palaging bumabalik ang parehong tanong: ginagamit ba natin ang boto para sa matalinong pagpili, o inuulit lang natin ang siklo ng kahangalan?
Hindi sapat ang dami kung bulag pa rin sa katotohanan. Sa datos mula sa GMA Integrated News Research, ang mayorya ng mga botante ngayong eleksyon ay mula sa edad 18 hanggang 44. Ito rin ang henerasyong sinasabing may akses sa impormasyon, ngunit sa kabalintunaan, pinaka-biktima rin ng disimpormasyon. Halos 10 milyong Pilipino ang nadagdag sa talaan ng mga rehistrado mula noong 2022. Sampung milyong bagong tinig, ngunit ito rin ba'y sampung milyong bagong target ng kasinungalingan at propaganda? Sa isang lipunang binabaha ng pekeng balita at mapanlinlang na mga pangako, hindi sapat ang pagrehistro. Kailangan din ng rebolusyon sa kritikal na pag-iisip.
At, sa kabila ng napakalaking bilang ng kabataang botante, tila nananatili pa rin tayong nakakulong sa bulok na pulitikal na kultura. Sa halip na mangibabaw ang mga talakayan hinggil sa edukasyon, agrikultura, trabaho, at reporma sa hustisya, ang umiiral ay personal branding, pangalan, at kasikatan. Marami sa mga kandidato ay nagpapaligsahan hindi sa ideya kundi sa paandar. Laban ito ng apelyido, hindi ng prinsipyo. Nakalulungkot na habang lumalaki ang bilang ng botante, lalo ring lumalalim ang kultura ng personality politics. Lumalawak ang hanay ng kabataang botante, ngunit hindi ito garantiya ng pagbabagong panlipunan hangga’t ang pulitika ay nananatiling isang laro ng pangalan at hindi ng layunin.
Habang ang mga kandidato ay nagpapaligsahan sa pagbibigay ng ayuda, libreng pabahay, at mga scholarship, ang kasaysayan ay nagpapatunay na maraming pangako ang nauuwi lamang sa alikabok. Vote-buying, o ang pagbili ng boto, ay nananatiling sugat sa ating demokrasya. Sa ilalim ng Section 261 ng Omnibus Election Code, ito'y isang election offense ngunit tila ito'y isang “open secret” na naging bahagi na ng kultura. Nitong taon lamang, 74 na show cause orders ang inilabas ng COMELEC laban sa mga kandidatong pinaghihinalaang sangkot sa vote-buying at paggamit ng state resources para sa kampanya. At sa kabila ng mga paalala, tuloy-tuloy pa rin ang “peraparaan”—mga botong ibinibenta kapalit ng pansamantalang kaginhawaan, habang ang kapalit ay anim na taong pagdurusa.
Ngunit hindi lamang pera ang isinusugal ng mga politiko. Pati ang dignidad ay kanilang nilalapastangan. Kamakailan, isang kandidato ang nakuhanan ng video na nagbibiro gamit ang kababaihan bilang paksa ng kabastusan. Bilang tugon, sinabi ni COMELEC Chairman George Garcia na maglalabas sila ng resolusyon para harapin ang isyu ng sexist remarks sa mga kampanya. Ngunit ang tanong: kailan pa naging katanggap-tanggap ang panghahamak sa kapwa bilang plataporma ng pangangampanya? Kung ngayon pa lang ay wala nang respeto ang isang kandidato, ano pa ang aasahan natin kapag siya’y nakaupo na sa puwesto?
Sa pinakahuli namang pre-election survey ng Social Weather Stations (SWS) na kinomisyon ng Stratbase Group, nangunguna si ACT-CIS Party-list Rep. Erwin Tulfo sa senatorial race na may 45% voter preference. Kasunod si Sen. Bong Go na may 43%. Pumapangalawa at pangatlo rin sina Vicente “Tito” Sotto at broadcaster Ben Tulfo. Marami sa kanila ay inendorso ng administrasyon. Ngunit kung susuriing mabuti, karamihan sa mga ito ay dati nang nanungkulan.
Kaya’t muling bumabalik ang tanong: sa dami ng pagkakataong naibigay na sa kanila, bakit tila hindi pa rin nararamdaman ang pagbabago?
Ngunit kailan pa naging sukatan ng pagiging karapat-dapat ang kasikatan? Ang survey ay salamin ng kasalukuyang pulso, ngunit hindi ito palaging sumasalamin sa hustisya o karunungan. Kapag ang mga pangalan sa itaas ng listahan ay batay sa recall at exposure, hindi ba’t tayo na rin ang pumipigil sa sariling pag-angat? Hindi kailangang maging doktor upang makilala ang sakit ng bansa: gutom, korapsyon, pag-abandona sa mga sektor na higit na nangangailangan. Ngunit sa tuwing pinipili natin ang “kilala,” hindi ang “karapat-dapat,” para tayong pasyenteng paulit-ulit na bumabalik sa manggagamot na hindi naman marunong maggamot at nagtataka kung bakit hindi gumagaling.
Kung maoobserbahan naman, araw-araw, milyun-milyong Pilipino ang nagigising sa gutom, sa kulang na pasahod, sa lumulubhang presyo ng bilihin, at sa bulok na sistema ng edukasyon at serbisyong pangkalusugan. Ngunit tuwing halalan, tila nawawala ang galit. Napapalitan ito ng kasiyahan sa entablado, ng papremyong raffle, at ng mga artista sa kampanya. Ang halalan ay hindi dapat peryahan. Hindi ito piyesta. Isa itong sagradong tungkulin—isang araw na kayang baguhin ang anim na taon ng ating buhay.
Para sa mga kabataan, hindi sapat ang hashtag na “#VoteWisely.” Kailangang unawain ang kandidato, suriin ang plataporma, ang kasaysayan, ang prinsipyo. Hindi pwedeng “kung sino ang sikat.” Hindi pwedeng “kung sino ang may malasakit.” Ang boto ay hindi premyo sa mga nagpakitang gilas; ito ay tiwala para sa mga may kakayahang mamuno.
May mga nagsasabi, "pare-pareho lang ‘yan." Ngunit ito’y isang mapanganib na pananaw. Ang pagboto ay hindi pagtanggap ng kapalaran kundi pagtuligsa sa kasinungalingan. Kung wala tayong paninindigan, paulit-ulit tayong lulubog sa parehong kangkungan. Hindi natin kailangang perpekto ang kandidato. Kailangan lang natin ng matino, may prinsipyo, at tunay na may malasakit sa bayan, hindi lang sa panahon ng eleksyon. Dahil kung pipili pa rin tayo batay sa pakulo, sa galaw sa entablado, sa kilig o kasikatan, tayo ang tunay na talo.
Ito ang huling paalala: ang dami nang may puso para sa mga mamamayan. Sana yung may utak naman para sa ikauunlad ng bayan. Huwag hayaang maging bulok ang binhi ng pag-asa. Bumoto nang may dignidad. Bumoto nang may paninindigan. Bumoto hindi dahil sa puso lang, kundi dahil sa utak na gising at mulat sa katotohanan.
Hindi natin kayang ulitin ang parehong pagkakamali. Ilang beses na tayong naloko ng matatamis na salita, ng mga pangakong nanlalamig pagkaupo sa puwesto, ng mga pulitikong tila laging handang tumulong kapag eleksyon, ngunit nawawala tuwing panahon ng krisis. Kailangan natin ng mga lider na hindi lang marunong umiyak sa entablado, kundi may tapang humarap sa mga ugat ng kahirapan. Hindi sapat ang galing sa kampanya; ang kailangan natin ay galing sa pamumuno.
Habang nangyayari ang halalan, tanungin natin ang sarili: ang bobotohin ba natin ay ang lider na kayang ipaglaban ang edukasyon, ang magsasaka, ang manggagawa, ang ordinaryong mamamayan? Dahil ang tunay na boto ay hindi lang para sa isang tao. Ito ay boto para sa uri ng kinabukasan na hinahangad nating mga Pilipino.
Sapagkat sa huli, ang halalan ay hindi lamang pagsubok sa mga kandidato. Isa rin itong pagsusulit sa sambayanang Pilipino. Pipili ba tayo ng matino at may paninindigan, o muling magpapadala sa kasikatan at kasinungalingan? Sa araw ng halalan, ang tanong ay hindi lamang kung sino ang mananalo, kundi kung tayo ba ay natuto. 
Halalan o hangalan? Huwag nang hayaang ang boto mo ang maging kabiguan ng buong bayan.</p>`,

Karapat-dapat mong madama na ikaw ay nag-iisa, hindi lamang sa araw na ito—araw-araw dapat ginugunita ang isang katulad mo. Ang lahat ng iyong paghihirap ay nakikita ko, hindi ko man ibuka ang bibig ko. Lahat ng iyong isinakripisyo ay ibabalik ko sa iyo nang buong-buo. 
Nay, mahal kita higit pa sa sinasabi ko. At hindi ko man masabi ang lahat ng ito, ang pagsisikap ko ngayon ay iniaalay ko sa iyo. Ang magandang buhay na ipinangarap mong makuha ko—ay para din sa iyo. 
Lumalaban ako hindi lang para sa sarili ko—lumalaban ako dahil nagtiwala kang lahat ng ito ay kaya ko.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Ang bawat butil ng kanin sa ating mga pinggan ay dumaan muna sa mga kamay ng isang magsasakang kumakayod kapalit ng munting salapi. Napagkakasya, ngunit halos hindi sapat para sa kaniyang pamilya. Sa bawat makintab na sulok at sahig na iyong dinaraanan sa paaralan, naroon ang mga kamay ng isang diyanitor na tahimik na nagtatrabaho, isinasakripisyo ang sariling ginhawa para sa ginhawa ng iba. 
Sa bawat sektor, maging ito ay serbisyo o produkto, palaging may mga taong naghahatid nito. Sa likod ng mga bagay na ating tinatamasa, naroon ang mga kamay ng mga indibidwal na nararapat nating alalahanin at pasalamatan.
Bunga ng masigasig na protesta ng libo-libong miyembro ng Union Obrera Democratica de Filipina (UODF), unang ipinagdiwang ang Araw ng Manggagawa sa Pilipinas noong ika-1 ng Mayo taong 1903. Ngayon, isang daan at dalawampu't taon na ang lumipas, patuloy tayong hinihikayat na isaalang-alang, kilalanin, at bigyang-hustisya ang lanat ng uri ng manggagawa sa ating bansa.
Bukod sa pagbibigay-pugay at panandaliang pamamahinga, ang araw na ito ay dapat ituon sa pakikibaka para sa karapatan ng ating mga tagapaglingkod, mula sa makatarungang sahod na nagbibigay ng tunay na halaga sa kanilang mga pawis, pantay na oportunidad na hindi sumasandal sa pangalan o koneksiyon, ligtas na kondisyon sa trabaho, at paggalang sa dignidad na tunay na ipinagkakaloob at hindi ipinapangako lamang tuwing eleksiyon.
Bilang ang kapalaran natin sa pagtatapos ng pag-aaral ay ang maging parte ng bagong henerasyon ng mga manggagawa ng bayan, kabilang sa ating responsibilidad ay patuloy na itulak ang reporma at pagbabago na isinulong ng mga ninuno natin. 
Ang kanilang pakikibaka ay hindi natatapos sapagkat pasan-pasan natin ito—ang kanilang mga yapak, kalyo, at pawis na itinaguyod. Ito ang kanilang maipamamana, ang pagsisikap at tiyaga sa pag-aalsa na naging puno’t dulo ng likas na kalayaan at ginhawa.</p>`,
