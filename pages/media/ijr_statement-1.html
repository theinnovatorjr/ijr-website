          <h4 class="hero-subtitle">
            The Innovator Jr. Official Statement on the Israel-Palestine Conflict
          </h4>
          <p class="hero-description">
            As the official publication of the students and associates of FEU Diliman's Basic Education Department, The Innovator Jr. stands firmly for truth, peace, and the protection of human rights.
          <br><br>
          This serves as the official statement of The Innovator Jr. in response to the recently agreed first-phase Gaza ceasefire deal of the Israeli and US government and, and more broadly, on the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict that persisted for decades.
          <br><br>
          On the 9th of October 2025, Israel approved and began executing the first phase of a ceasefire deal in Gaza—an agreement that is meant to mark the end of the relentless bloodshed on the land of the olive trees. Yet, even after this decision, it remains unclear whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the military forces of Israel to stop fighting as reports of continued attacks continue.
          <br><br>
          This statement seeks to shed light on the realities that lie beneath the supposed ceasefire, to question if this would stop the on-going genocide to Palestine when occupation by Israel has yet to be lifted.
          </p>
          <h4 class="hero-subtitle">Roots of the Problem</h4>
          <p class="hero-description">
            Palestinians have lived under occupation for moreover 75 years due to the 1917 Balfour Declaration made by British foreign secretary Arthur James Balfour. In this declaration, the United Kingdom expressed support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, completely disregarding the presence of the huge Arab population residing there. This was largely influenced by the rise of Zionism, a nationalist movement seeking a Jewish homeland after years of antisemitism. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, Britain assumed control with the British Mandate of Palestine. This worsened the tensions between the Jewish immigrants and Arab residents, putting the communities in deep division and unrest that would only intensify as years to come.
            <br><br>
            When the United Kingdom began to lose control of both sides, it eventually gave up control and passed the issue to the newly formed United Nations in 1947. The UN proposed the Partition Plan, a plan that would divide the Jewish and Arab states, but instead triggered war due to the rejection of Arab leaders for its unfair land distribution between the two groups. This led to the 1948 Nakba, or ‘The Catastrophe,’ when 750,000 Palestinians were displaced from their homes as a result of the establishment of Israel under the Zionist movement, thus the land was divided into three which are Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip.
            <br><br>
            From then on, Palestinians have lived under different forms of occupation such as the Armistice Green Line, the Intifadas, and the Oslo and Abraham Accords, all of which would fuel the flame of the attack on southern Israel.
            <br><br>
            On the 7th of October 2023, the Islamic Resistance Movement called Hamas which was created during the time of the first Intifada, attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. The group described the attack as an outcome to decades of Israeli oppression, the killings of Palestinians, and years-long blockade of the Gaza Strip. They want to form a future independent state, but Israel's current government does not recognise the right of the Palestinians to do so, arguing that it would be a security threat.
            <br><br>
            In response, Israel launched a massive military offensive against Hamas in Gaza following the 7th October of 2023 attack. It began with air strikes and was followed by a ground invasion, eventually escalating into pure annihilation until the 9th of October 2025.
            <br><br>
            <strong>TLDR:
            Palestinians have lived under occupation for moreover 75 years due to the British Mandate for Palestine and the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, which then led to the establishment of Israel and the displacement of 750,000 Palestinians from their homes in the 1948 Nakba or ‘The Catastrophe.’ After many continued conflicts, restrictions, and failed peace accord efforts like Oslo and Abraham. It all fueled the Hamas’ attack on 7th of October 2023— an act of resistance due to decades of oppression. It was then followed by Israel’s devastating military offensive which led to the abuse of power and genocidal acts in Palestine that lasted until the 9th of October 2025.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <h4 class="hero-subtitle">Our Stand</h4>
          <p class="hero-description">
            The Innovator Jr. condemns the genocide committed by the Israeli government against the Palestinian people. While Hamas’ violence must also be held accountable, it cannot be used as a pretext to erase Gaza or the right of Palestinians to live freely. With the findings of the United Nations Commission of Inquiry highlighting the violence that Israel has done in the Gaza Strip, we denounce the continued bombing of civilian areas even after the ceasefire’s first phase was enacted as reported by news outlets such as the Anadolu Agency, Al-Manar TV Lebanon, and Middle East Eye, which includes acts that blatantly violate the principles of international humanitarian law and the very essence of human rights laid out through the framework made by the United Declaration of Human Rights of 1948.
            <br><br>
            A ceasefire does not equate to the freedom of the Palestinian people. It stops the bombs but not the blockade, the suffering from attacks but not the suffering from the rubble Palestinians have to go back to. Even as negotiations unfold between the two groups, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s refusal to recognize Palestine’s statehood during the United Nations on the 26th of September 2025 means that true liberation remains distant. Until Palestine’s sovereignty is acknowledged and its people are allowed to self-determination without Israel’s occupation, these agreements remain empty gestures; a performance. Peace written on paper, but not lived in practice.
            <br><br>
            As student journalists of The Innovator Jr., we believe that standing with Palestine is not a matter of politics or religion, but of principle. It is a commitment to the universal right of all people to live free from oppression. Furthermore, it is important to take note that our condemnation is directed at the Israeli government and military— not Jewish people, Antisemitism will never be accepted and tolerated in our organization. Likewise, we reject the use of Zionism or religious belief as a justification for human rights violations.
            <br><br>
            <strong>
              TLDR: The Innovator Jr. condemns the Israeli government’s genocide against Palestinians and calls for accountability on all sides without justifying Gaza’s erasure. A ceasefire does not equate to the freedom of the Palestinian people. Until Palestine’s sovereignty is acknowledged and its people are allowed to self-determination without Israel’s occupation or siege, these agreements remain empty gestures; a performance. Peace written on paper, but not lived in practice.

          <h4 class="hero-subtitle">Our Message</h4>
          <p class="hero-description-center">
            To the Israeli government: ceasefire is not mercy but an act of overdue acknowledgement of humanity; one you have long denied to the Palestinian people. History is recording, and the world is watching.
            <br><br>
            To our fellow journalists, we write as a witness of history: we will continue to tell and amplify the stories others try to silence.
            <br><br>
            To the world: neutrality in the face of oppression is not peace, it is complicity. It is a sign of privilege.
            <br><br>
            To the people of Palestine: the world stands with you.
            <br><br>
            As the official publication of the students and associates of FEU Diliman's Basic Education Department,
            <br><br>
            The Innovator Jr. stands with humanity, and with the notion:<br>
            <strong>From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.</strong>
